<p>I am currently working on a tutorial of HTTP/1.1 caching, but I got stuck with the following statement in RFC7232 section 2.2.2:</p>
<p>" This method relies on the fact that if two different responses were sent by the origin server during the same second, but both had the same Last-Modified time, then at least one of those responses would have a Date <a href="http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7231.html#header.date" rel="nofollow noopener">http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7231.html#header.date</a> value equal to its Last-Modified time. The arbitrary 60-second limit guards against the possibility that the Date and Last-Modified values are generated from different clocks or at somewhat different times during the preparation of the response. An implementation /MAY/ use a value larger than 60 seconds, if it is believed that 60 seconds is too short."</p>
<p>I don’t understand why under the circumstance above, at least one of those responses would have a Date value equal to its Last-Modified time.</p>
<p>And what’s the point of ensuring a 60 seconds gap between the Last-Modified time and Date?</p>
