<p>I’ve often wondered why this doesn’t exist already as I am <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13211453/css-how-to-say-classlast-of-type-classes-not-elements" rel="nofollow noopener">not</a> the first to think this would be useful. Perhaps there’s some implementation technicalities that I’ve not considered (most likely!).</p>
<p>On occasion you may have a list of similar elements followed by an element which is not so similar. If you want to style the last element of your “similar” elements you can’t use :last-child. <a href="http://jsbin.com/maninu/2/" rel="nofollow noopener">Here’s a really simple example</a>. In this example, imagine you want to remove the border of the last “thing”. You can’t use :last-child because that matches the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Of course there are many workarounds for this limitation. Notably the following spring to mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Add another class to the last item”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or alternatively</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“wrap the elements which are similar in some other element (perhaps an
(un)ordered list for semantics) and then use last-child”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While these are of course perfectly valid, and in some situations will actually be a better or (arguably) more semantic solution, sometimes it’s extra hassle that could easily be avoided if we had something like <strong>:last-of-class(‘thing’)</strong></p>
<p>Are there issues with this proposal that I might have not considered?</p>

<p>The spec already covers this, via <code>:nth-child()</code>.  You can pass a selector argument to specialize the counting to only cover things matching that selector.  This hasn’t been implemented by anyone yet, to my knowledge.</p>
<p>If the selector you want to use is just a type selector, <code>:nth-of-type()</code> works.  In that JSBin, for example, a selector like <code>div:last-of-type</code> would select the last “thing” as expected.</p>

<p>+1 Yep, <code>:last-of-type</code> is probably what’s needed. Note also, <span class="mention">@Wills</span>, that <code>nth-last-of-type()</code> can be used to count back from the final instance of that type. So, for example, <code>p:nth-last-of-type(2)</code> would match each instance of a penultimate paragraph.</p>
<p>There’s very little you can’t do with the extant CSS3 selectors, in my experience. Especially since you can concatenate them. Eg. <code>p:nth-child(even):nth-last-of-type(3)</code> would match any even occurences of a <code>p</code> if they are also third last in a succession of <code>p</code>s. Not that you’d need that particular one very often…</p>

<p><span class="mention">@tabatkins</span> Thanks, I didn’t think to check the draft spec for Selectors Level 4. <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/selectors4/#the-nth-child-pseudo">Here’s the relevant part of the spec</a> for others interested. This enhanced nth-child spec is exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@heydonworks</span> I’m aware of nth-of-type and last-of-type but using those results in a brittle solution which doesn’t actually select the element for the reasons the element is being targeted (in this case). Just because the element is the second-to-last child at the moment, doesn’t mean it will always be. It’s just a happy coincidence of the provided example. The same applies for if I’d have used last-of-type. If I suddenly needed to change the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> to a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in my HTML, I’d have to go and find and alter the CSS for the (unrelated) element and update the <code>n</code> value for the nth-last-of-type.</p>

<p>I wasn’t suggesting you use <code>nth-last-of-type</code>. All you need is <code>last-of-type</code> as <span class="mention">@tabatkins</span> suggested. I was just mentioning <code>nth-last-of-type</code> as an additional tool for more complex scenarios. You say ‘brittle’, I say ‘specific’ <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="//discourse.wicg.io/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:"/> Naturally, you’ll want to be as unspecific as you can get away with. Just using an extreme example to show what’s possible in current implementations.</p>

<p>My point was that using last-of-type in some situations just <strong>coincidentally</strong> happens to select the right element.</p>
<p>I said this was brittle as if you were to add another element of the same type then the last-of-type selector would no longer match the desired element. Whereas if last-child(.my-class) were available it would (assuming the new element didn’t also have that class of course…). Usually in these situations where I need to select these sorts of elements my though process is something like “I need to select the last .my-class element and remove the border”. Element type doesn’t come into it.</p>
<p>Basically I’m saying type selectors are often best avoided as they are too broad, as demonstrated by the above example ;).</p>
