<p>Searching for “alternatives to CSS outside of browsers” (f.e. styling systems in GTK, Qt, etc) yields no useful results, as usually they lead to articles on CSS pre-processors or css-in-js.</p>
<p>Are there styling systems that are better than CSS (in your opinion, and even if they do not run in a browser environment)?</p>
<p>I’m curious to know what styling paradigms exist, if any, that some may consider more evolved, more efficient, easier, more robust, or more advanced than CSS.</p>
<p>Or, is CSS the best styling paradigm there is? (In your opinion)</p>
<p>From what I can tell, the GTK and Qt engines have both adopted CSS-based styling mechanisms. For example, Gnome 3 Desktop came out with GTK CSS as the first-class styling mechanism.</p>
<p>If there doesn’t exist anything better (in your opinion), have you ever imagined something better?</p>

<p>In my opinion CSS is good enough in its current view. But such design has limitations. Probably, it could reach Turing completeness in the future (today we already have semi-conditions, variables and functions like calc). And if so, then lisp-like language could solve the same task better with more simpler parser.</p>

<p>There are styling languages that are Turing complete – have a look at DSSSL or XSL. Adding such more advanced features to CSS while retaining backward compatibility is and will be mess.</p>

<p>I typically see it done either similar to SVG without CSS (set it directly on the node itself - pro: no need to resolve selectors, con: harder to reuse code) or literally using CSS, XSL, or other similar stylesheet languages (pro: easier to reuse code, con: need to resolve selectors).</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS, Android, Windows universal apps (their C# APIs), and macOS all use XML attributes on the nodes themselves - they don’t use shared stylesheets whatsoever.</li>
<li>X and Windows native (their C/C++ APIs) use direct function calls instead, but they otherwise work equivalently.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html" rel="nofollow noopener">JavaFX uses CSS, with a lot of <code>-fx-*</code> properties.</a> If you’re used to web, this is a bit of a mind bender to use as it’s both too similar and not similar enough to the browser (they vendor-prefix a lot of properties that browsers don’t, like <code>-fx-font</code> and <code>-fx-background-color</code>, which work functionally identically to the corresponding unprefixed properties used in browsers) and it’s difficult to context-switch properly, as I learned the hard way while toying with this trying to build an app using Kotlin.</li>
<li>Qt’s QML is similar to Android and iOS in that they just set attributes on the nodes themselves.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/chap-css-overview.html" rel="nofollow noopener">GTK supports CSS natively</a> and appears to prefer that idiomatically. <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/chap-css-properties.html" rel="nofollow noopener">There are a few <code>-gtk-*</code> properties, but they appear to stick very close to what browsers use.</a>
</li>
<li>I’m starting to see a pattern emerge among virtual DOM users (both React and elsewhere) where they literally set <code>style={{"background-color": someColor}}</code> and similar. So it’s not entirely exclusive to outside browsers.</li>
<li>XSL has basically died in terms of UI styling AFAICT. I’ve seen it literally once and it was on the MIME type registry listing where they presented a raw XML file with an XSL stylesheet to render it to HTML instead of just returning a static HTML file.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll find better luck if you just scan the docs for those frameworks - there’s no real search query that can give you good answers to this in one consolidated place.</p>

<p>Seems like CSS is the best so far, but it seems that people are itching for something better, but can’t exactly nail it down yet. I believe this is why there are so many CSS-in-JS libs. F.e., here’s a long non-exhaustive list of them in this CSSTRicks article <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-fragmented-but-evolving-state-of-css-in-js/" rel="nofollow noopener"> The Fragmented, But Evolving State of CSS-in-JS</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the main things people want:</p>
<ul>
<li>easy inheritance (JS objects have inheritance, as alternative to cascade, but also scoped to lexical scope)</li>
<li>no globals (lexical scope)</li>
<li>clash-free class names inside of scope.</li>
<li>attribute like styling that is overridable (HTML <code>style</code> attribute can’t be overriden, only overwritten)</li>
<li>functions</li>
<li>scoped variables (CSS has vars, but they’re global)</li>
<li>more</li>
</ul>
<p>What no one has:</p>
<ul>
<li>custom properties, that can be scoped to component types</li>
<li>Custom rendering for custom properties
<ul>
<li>at the moment it is impossible (or very difficult) to define new rendering abilities for custom properties</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ability to react to style changes on an element, based on changing of any upstream styles (very difficult, very easy to get wrong with MutationObserver vs new Houdini APIs).</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>XSL is in two parts; XSLT, originally to transform documents into
things you knew how to style, and XSL-FO, that specifies a way to put
CSS properties onto XML elements and how to control the document flow
through pages.</p>
<p>XSL-FO is not widely used outside print (but your bank statement or
your driving licence might have been formatted with it).</p>
<p>XSLT is widely used, including for generating HTML, but you tend only
to see the resulting HTML.</p>

<p>I suppose XSL is not desirable compared to CSS.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, the vast amount of CSS-in-JS libs in existence are effectively equivalent to feature requests for improvements to CSS. Maybe CSS would benefit from adopting some concepts from those libs?</p>
