<p>I’ve written more base64 encoders and decoders than I care to remember over the years.</p>
<p><code>atob()</code> and <code>btoa()</code> are awful APIs.  Their binary representation is packed into a string which has to be extracted using <code>.charCodeAt()</code>.  While <code>btoa()</code> might be fixed by having it accept a <code>BufferSource</code>, and maybe <code>atob()</code> might be redeemed by adding an extra parameter, I think that the encoding API is a more natural fit.</p>
<p>Imagine this as a 6-bit per-symbol encoding of a limited subset of the full character space (i.e., only 64 different code points are recognized and encoded correctly).</p>
<p>What is perhaps strange about this is that you would use a decoder to encode and an encoder to decode in the classic sense:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">// 'A' is the encoded form, but we use a decoder to produce it.
console.log(new TextDecoder('base64').decode(new Uint8Array([0]))); // -&gt; 'A'
console.log(new TextEncoder('base64').encode('A')); // -&gt; 0
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe that enough of a reason that this isn’t quite the right idea.  I’m also happy to patch <code>atob()</code> and <code>btoa()</code>, but this seems like a better fit.</p>
<p>Edit: Forgot some of the rationale: While it is relatively easy to do base64 yourself, few implementations do this well.  In particular, with WebCrypto, there is greater need for constant-time encodings of binary data and I’m not aware of any of those.  The Firefox <code>btoa()</code> implementation almost certainly isn’t constant time.</p>

<p>This has been suggested multiple times - in fact, when I was first proposing the Encoding API it supported base64. Consensus was to remove it since it was out of scope (it’s not a “text encoding”) and also the encoding-with-a-decoder/decoding-with-an-encoder confusion. I tripped myself up several times on it and I’d written the spec. <img alt=":frowning:" class="emoji" src="//discourse.wicg.io/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:"/></p>
<p>That said, I think there’s pretty broad agreement that a <code>BufferSource</code> <img alt=":left_right_arrow:" class="emoji" src="//discourse.wicg.io/images/emoji/twitter/left_right_arrow.png?v=5" title=":left_right_arrow:"/> base64 <code>DOMString</code> API would be useful if we can come up with a sensible place to put it. Past discussions have usually ended with “can we just wedge it into <code>btoa</code>/<code>atob</code> somehow?” and the proposer lost interest in figuring out if that was possible or not. So I’d follow that track if possible.</p>

<p><code>atob</code> and <code>btoa</code> aren’t feasible I think.  You would need to have a signal that would allow you to have <code>atob</code> return an <code>ArrayBuffer</code>.  It’s unlikely that would be backwardly compatible.</p>
