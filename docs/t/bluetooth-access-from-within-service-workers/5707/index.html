<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Allow bluetooth access to devices that the user has already paired with from a service worker.</p>
<p><strong>Security / Privacy</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The user would have to selected and paired the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could have an additional permission that says “This app would like to connect to bluetooth devices in the background.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This functionality could also additionally be limited to installed PWAs</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Native</strong></p>
<p>Currently this functionality is available in native, and unless there are plans to remove background bluetooth access from native I can’t see good arguments for not allowing it at least for installed PWAs.</p>
<p><strong>Use Case</strong></p>
<p>Quick Summary: For receiving and printing online orders.</p>
<p><em>Detailed:</em></p>
<p>In each shop we have a POS terminal (either an ipad or an Android tablet) with a POS software running as a PWA.</p>
<p>There are two (or more) printers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A Label Printer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Thermal Receipt Printer</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When an order is placed on the system, labels are printed using the label printer so they can be stuck on the box and a receipt is printed on the thermal printer. In this case the PWA is active and can just use web-bluetooth as normal as long as both devices are connected.</p>
<p>Online Orders are received through the server, while the application is running it’s possible to open a web-socket connection to receive the online order and then immediately print both a label and a receipt when one is received. The issue is when the application is not active as the staff often need to switch to other apps.</p>
<p>The ideal solution would be to use PUSH API to wake a service worker, which can immediately connect to the bluetooth printers and print. This way if the device is idle or a user is using another application the printing process can continue uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Note that this entire process is possible within native apps, but is not possible with service workers / web-bluetooth. I realize there are possible privacy/security concerns, but I think a good general stance is if you can do it on native, you should be able to do it on the web. If the privacy/security risks are too big to be mitigated by any process then that functionality should also be removed from native.</p>
<p><strong>Push API</strong></p>
<p>There are current issues with devices that are in sleep mode not waking the service worker. To fix that issue we would likely need a method of labelling high priority push which is guaranteed to wake the device.</p>
