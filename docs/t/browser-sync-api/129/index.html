<p>I’ve started a W3C community group to discuss potentially standardizing browser sync, both as a way to make the backend more open to user control and to expose an API so that web app developers can make use of the built-in sync mechanism for their own apps’ client-side data.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in joining the discussion there, I’d love to have more members in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/browsersync/" title="Browser Sync Community Group">Browser Sync Community Group</a>. I also wrote up a blog post, <a href="https://medium.com/@rfreebern/open-sync-your-browser-data-in-your-hands-8b533b95f9db" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Open Sync: Your Browser Data in Your Hands">“Open Sync: Your Browser Data in Your Hands”</a> to help explain why I think this is a worthwhile goal.</p>
<p>I’d love to have some discussion of what the API should look like. For instance, people have pointed out that it would be great if browser A could receive an event when browser B pushes some data. It’s also been mentioned that having built-in operational transforms would be very nice, but maybe out of scope.</p>
<p>Any ideas are welcome at this point.</p>

<p>I asked Alex about this and he thinks the two efforts are essentially unrelated. See discussion <a href="https://twitter.com/rfreebern/status/471675902016094210" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>I read him saying the goals overlap, but the approaches are different (with which I agree); I guessthe fact that the app-data sync being potentially covered by BackgroundSync may not make it the best initial focus for the browser sync effort (which I applaud).</p>

<p>I can’t speak for the rest of the Chrome team (my opinions are my own here).  I’m sure Chrome supporting something like this would add a ton of complexity and new challenges for the already overloaded chrome sync team.  However I wanted to say that I support this goal.</p>
<p>The web’s unique strength as a platform is interoperability and reliable competition (due to low switching costs for users).  Sync is a great counter example to my argument here: <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RickByers/posts/Uq4RR9MuLHs" rel="nofollow noopener">https://plus.google.com/+RickByers/posts/Uq4RR9MuLHs</a> (based on Tim Wu’s excellent book “The Master Switch”).</p>
<p>I’ll try to get someone who knows about sync in Chrome to at least comment on this thread.</p>
