<p>(Let’s hope that this is deemed relevant and I am not subject to harsh punishment)</p>
<p>Specifiction is a great way to widen participation, but all of these means so far have some similarities in that it is difficult to imagine what would happen if even 1% of developers suddenly actually got involved in Web Standards.  Since one of the aims of the Extensible Web Manifesto is to dramatically increase developer involvement, I think we need some new thoughts and experiments in how to accomplish this.</p>
<p>A few of us are putting together pilot programs, and I’ve written about it <a href="https://medium.com/p/web-standards-we-want-part-i-chapters-ca71985bf914">here</a>.  I’m interested both in your thoughts, as well as just spreading word to get people thinking about the problem above.</p>

<p>I love the idea, and would like to try it out in my local dev community; that being said, it would probably be easier for me to do so after some people have gathered experience with it, and ideally formalized some of that experience in some kind of how-to-organize-your-Web-standard-chapter <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="//discourse.wicg.io/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

<p>Having witnessed a similar effort with Test the Web Forward, my overall feeling is that while good for evangelization, the actual output of such gathering isn’t of high quality/very useful. This doesn’t mean that the exercise is futile, just that if your purpose is other than evangelization, there <em>might</em> be more effective solutions.</p>

<p>As <span class="mention">@briankardell</span> knows well, I am very supportive of this idea <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" src="//discourse.wicg.io/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:"/></p>
<p>I’m happy to set up a Paris chapter (and certainly happy for help with it).</p>
<p><span class="mention">@tobie</span> I agree that we shouldn’t be overly optimistic about it and we should start with simple expectations. Already having a place for Web developers who care about standards to socialise is a good first step: that’s how a lot of stuff got started.</p>
<p>Then as we start building extra infrastructure, people can start contributing progressively. Keep in mind that TestTWF suffers from a limitation that this idea doesn’t: here we are talking about local user groups that could for instance meet every months. If they did that for testing, the quality and commitment would certainly increase over time! In fact, Chapters could take responsibility for local TestTWF/WPT hacking.</p>

<p>Yeah, I’d like to throw out there too that it’s not necessarily apples to apples WRT TTWF.  Even people who write specs and implementations don’t want to write tests, that’s why they aren’t there already.  It’s kind of a pain in the ass, we even lack some good mechanisms.  I’m not trying to knock it, I think TTWF is a great effort, but it seems hard to have it exist on its own like that and be -really- productive.  By being more encompassing and promising to potentially deliver some value both ways, I’m hoping this idea is a little more palatable and interesting with some staying power.  We’ll see I guess.</p>

<p>Tonight, our pilot group for Chapters started looking at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.closest">Element.closest</a> and specifically, were interested in posting up to MDN a prollyfill (essentially <a href="https://github.com/jonathantneal/closest/blob/master/closest.js">Jonathan Neal’s</a>) <em>and</em> porting some relevant tests from <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/unit/traversing.js#L326">jQuery</a> which pioneered the basic API.  The aim would simply be to provide a set of tests that native implementations should also pass and attempt to think of edge cases and so on – but the question quickly came up of <em>how</em> exactly.  We’ve had a number of efforts like this (promises, for example or my own ref-tests for things in selectors L4, and we have others that use qunit) and they’ve all done something different.  I suppose creating tests that are easy to port is one thing, but it might be nice if as a community at least we could synchronize on a way that works commonly… Anyone have thoughts?  Would TTWF, for example, even touch this in its current state - as far as I am aware it isn’t in a W3C draft anywhere even.  We can assume it will eventually I think since there are already implementations and it’s in the DOM Living standard…</p>

<p>You can definitely add tests for <code>Element.closest</code> to the DOM tests (note that WPT is jointly operated by W3C and the WHATWG, or more broadly by the Web community).</p>
<p>Also, in general, I don’t think there’s any issue with adding tests for things that are being implemented even without a spec. If we get tests before a draft, I for one won’t complain <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="//discourse.wicg.io/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

<p>Definitely use web-platform-tests format. Even if it isn’t accepted into the main repo, it’d still be best to have tests in that format so they can be eventually run by browsers and incorporated into web-platform-tests.</p>
<p>(Promises ideally would have been written in test262 format, which is the other major shared-among-vendors format.)</p>
