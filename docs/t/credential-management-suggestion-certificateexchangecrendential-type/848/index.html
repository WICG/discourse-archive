<p>After reading the spec (see <a href="https://notes.webplatform.org/stream?q=tag:%27webappsec-cm%27">my notes here</a>), and a conversation with people in the security industry, a question came up to mind (<a href="https://notes.webplatform.org/a/AU1Ib3pFg7sL1apB_AzE">in context</a>) and I thought i’d create a separate thread <a href="//discourse.wicg.io/t/credential-management-api-proposed-at-w3c/806/4?u=renoirb">from the announcement</a>.</p>
<p>We could have <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/credentialmanagement/#interfaces-credential-types">a <code>CertificateExchangeCredential</code> <em>type</em></a> from which the browser could manage its locally stored certificates. A user could have many web browsers with their own certificates.</p>
<p>A way to go might be that we can send a list of “acceptable” public certificates only once the user is already signed in.</p>
<p>Next sign-on process would only be to make a handshake with one of his previously generated private certificates. Provided the user previously did whitelist his certificates from his current browser last time he was authenticated.</p>
<p>Benefits from this is that a user could control the number of certificates he has, use it on more than one site, and use the browser itself to manage them.</p>
<p>It this out of scope? Has this been suggested?</p>
<p><strong>PS</strong> I might be wrong and I know its close to WebID. But I still have doubts it had been implemented like this yet.</p>

<p>It’s an interesting concept certainly, I’m not sure I understand fully the process flow you are suggesting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the certificate TLS related or some of key to encrypt the data lower down the stack?</li>
<li>So the first use of <code>CertificateExchangeCredential</code> doesn’t use the certificate?</li>
<li>Is the main line of security here ‘a priori’ with using a previous certificate to encrypt from the browser to get another certificate on completion?</li>
<li>Would the user need to approve adding these certificates?</li>
