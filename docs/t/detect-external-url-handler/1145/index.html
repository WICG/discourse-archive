<p>Currently, browsers allow to launch external applications by following urls for which the browser or the system know how to handle the scheme. mailto: is a classical example.</p>
<p>This mechanism is a simple way to launch external application (or an extension, etc).
Most browsers require the user to confirm the execution of such action.</p>
<p>However, there is no standard way, and often, no way at all to detect beforehand that an handler is registered for a given protocol scheme.
There is also no proper way to handler failure case</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like to discuss adding an api that would allow to query whether a particular protocol scheme has a known registered handler.</p>
<p>it could be added to the navigator object:</p>
<pre><code>navigator.isProtocolHandlerRegistered("foo")
</code></pre>
<p>This metthod would complement the already existing</p>
<pre><code>navigator.registerProtocolHandler()
</code></pre>
<p>I don’t think there in a need to return all available protocols, so a method that test whether a single protocol is sufficient.
There is also no need to know what application manage a given handler and whether this handler is a web application or a native application</p>
<p>Security concerns:</p>
<p>This method could probably be used to query whether a given application is installed, but I don’t think that it would be a real concern as exposed application can probably detected anyway.</p>
<p>This method should not request a user permission, but the actual url opening still should.</p>

<p>Besides this security vulnerability this is also a privacy violation. I don’t think this proposal will get beyond this hurdle I’m afraid.</p>

<p>Currently, applications that want to offer the abilities to be launch from the browser use all kind of nastiness like plugins, which is probably a bigger security risk.</p>
<p>The security &amp; privacy concerns can probably be resolved with global settings (rather than per site settings). Or maybe a per site setting would be acceptable if treated as the gps location is,in a not to intrusive fashion.</p>
<p>This feature would enable a lot of synergies for applications like app store (steam for example). Spotify/itunes also have/had some similar workflow through native plugin.</p>
<p>So while I agree the security/privacy concern are of importancen they should not close the discussion completely. You can find numerous content on the web asking how to do exactly this.</p>
<p>Moreover mailto: is widely deployed and usually works because a client mail is often available, but in the case no mail client is install the UX is currently quite bad</p>
