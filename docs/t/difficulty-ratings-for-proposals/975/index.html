<p>So, when somebody proposes a spec, one of the most valuable pieces of feedback toward the creation of an action plan is a summary of what would be required to make the spec a reality. Some of the factors that feed into this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have there been existing discussions around this?</li>
<li>Are UAs already doing this, just in non-standard / non-exposed ways? (I was opposed to Shadow DOM until somebody explained that it was something all the major browsers already had infrastructure for.)</li>
<li>As a combination of the last two, is this already a sub-behavior of a larger specification that could just be made more versatile? Examples:
<ul>
<li>The deep clone algorithm, which is currently specified as part of specs like postMessage but not actually available as a standalone function</li>
<li>The way <a href="//discourse.wicg.io/t/hide-whitespace-only-text-nodes/973/1">hiding whitespace-only text nodes</a> is part of Flexbox</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What would be involved in polyfilling it (usually this is a similar discussion to “Are UAs already doing it?”)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is basically a <a href="//discourse.wicg.io/t/wicg-best-practices/942">Best Common Practices</a> memo on the subject of what factors go into making a spec reality, though there could maybe be some kind of sub-group / tiger team within/alongside WICG (reaching out to UA devs) that goes around doing structured appraisals for this in discussions (ie. “As a heads up, this would be a Class C change because it’s not polyfillable and would require all-new logic to support”).</p>
