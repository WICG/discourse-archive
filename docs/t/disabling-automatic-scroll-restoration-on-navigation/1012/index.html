<p><strong>Note</strong>: This has already been proposed on <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2015Mar/0070.html">whatwg</a> mailing list. The consensus so far has been that it is a important problem to fix and I have incorporated several round of feedback on the API design. I am hoping to cast a wider net here and get additional feedback (and hopefully buy in) from other vendors and interested parties.</p>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Add a new boolean attribute to history in order to allow web developer to opt out of automatic scroll restoration that occurs during navigation. This allows developers to get rid of their brittle hacks around it. We are very interested to solve this issue in blink and I have a <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=477353" rel="nofollow noopener">working patch</a> behind a flag.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://majido.github.io/scroll-restoration-proposal/history-based-api.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Unofficial spec</a></li>
<li><a href="http://majido.github.io/scroll-restoration-proposal/tests/" rel="nofollow noopener">Tests</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Problem Summary</h2>
<p>History [spec][current-spec] does not specify the scroll position persistence and
restoration and leaves it up to user agents to implement. All major
browsers provide scroll restoration functionality for both traditional document
navigations and entries create via History API (i.e., pushState, and
replaceState). Despite its prevalence there is currently no reliable and cross-
browser solution for developers to opt out of this behaviour or control any of
its aspects.</p>
<p>The default scroll restoring behaviour works well for document style web sites
but it is often not appropriate for single-page web applications. Precise
controlling of the scroll restoration is particularly important for single-page
applications due to the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They may be re-constructing the page content onpopstate every time and
often asynchronously. The user agent does not know when page is fully
constructed so it may attempt to restore scroll position on a partially
constructed page which has an incorrect size causing the scroll to land on an
unintended incorrect position due to clamping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They may want to provide consistent scroll restoration regardless of how
the page is entered e.g., via history navigation or vanilla links clicks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They may want to control the details of visual transition between UI states
for example using a specific scrolling animation to transition instead of an
instant jump, or even restoring scroll position of inner scrollers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>We propose to modify History API and make it possible for web authors to explicitly disable the default scroll restoration behavior. This is achieved by adding a new attribute, <code>scrollRestoration</code>, to <code>window.history</code>. This new attribute can take two values: ‘auto’, ‘manual’ with ‘auto’ being the default.</p>
<p>Setting scrollRestoration to a new value updates the current entry in history session. Also any future entry that is added to history session for the same document will use this new scrollRestoration value. However, changing this value does not impact any previous entries in sessions history including those that belong to the same document. Furthermore, any navigation to a new page with a different document resets the <code>scrollRestoration</code> to its default value.</p>
<p>Note that this ensures that changes to scrollRestoration only affect entries that will be created for the same document (e.g., entries created using pushState, or due to fragment navigation).</p>
<pre><code>enum ScrollRestoration {
    "auto",
    "manual"
};

partial interface History {
     attribute ScrollRestoration scrollRestoration;
};
</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>scrollRestoration</code></strong>: Indicates whether the user agent should restore scroll position when traversing to this entry. Anytime this attribute is modified the current entry in joint session history should be updated to reflect the change.</p>

<p>Beyond just scroll position, I’d like there to be mechanisms for controlling <em>other</em> UA behaviors around history. I started writing some thoughts on those, but I think, since they’re separate (albeit related) concerns, they should be proposed in their own thread: see <a href="//discourse.wicg.io/t/cached-content-updating-and-state-saving/1014">Cached Content Updating and State Saving</a>.</p>
<h2>Declarability review</h2>
<p>Also, with any new proposal, I think it’s important that, rather than ask “why use a declarative mechanism for this?”, we should instead ask “why not?”, lest the platform devolve into <a href="//discourse.wicg.io/t/a-defense-of-declarative-content/988">a mess of flavor-of-the-month client-side framework-ism even worse than the way web development already is</a>.</p>
<p>That being said - even though this Scroll Restoration property <em>could</em> be expressed with something like a <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag - in this case, I agree that this should only be exposed to scripting, since its functionality (disabling plain-content treatment of scroll position) only makes sense for dynamic pages - exposing it <em>declaratively</em> would exclusively serve to make it <em>easier</em> for content to misguidedly disable a useful behavior for unfounded reasons (akin to the way some pages, usually written around 2005, use <code>&lt;body oncontextmenu="alert('Right click disabled')"&gt;</code> because they think it “protects” them).</p>

<p>Agreed. I am going to comment under that topic itself but just wanted to note that we think scale restoration control can be exposed with a <a href="https://github.com/majido/scroll-restoration-proposal/issues/4" rel="nofollow noopener">similar API</a>, and perhaps in future we can <a href="https://github.com/majido/scroll-restoration-proposal/issues/5" rel="nofollow noopener">expose the actual recorded scroll position</a> (and scale value).</p>

<p>For some more context, here is a list of alternative APIs that have been considered before reaching consensus on the current design:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <a href="http://majido.github.io/scroll-restoration-proposal/event-based-api.html" rel="nofollow noopener">events</a> to allow detection of various state restorations and their prevention. This requires the state restoration to be done after DOMReady which leads to <a href="https://github.com/majido/scroll-restoration-proposal/issues/3" rel="nofollow noopener">unacceptable UX</a>.</li>
<li>Use a <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2015Mar/0070.html">fourth optional argument on pushState, replaceState</a> to declare restoration preference. This was deemed too complex for simple cases and also <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2015Jul/0052.html">unnecessarily linked scrolled restoration with state creation</a>.</li>
<li>Same as <span class="hashtag">#2</span> but with <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2015Mar/0166.html">two new methods</a> (i.e., push, replace) that take a dictionary as argument. This advantages of a cleaner API didn’t out-weigh <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2015Apr/0109.html">backward compatibility concerns</a>.</li>

<p>Note that this API is <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5657284784947200" rel="nofollow noopener">now shipping in Chrome 46</a>, and we’ve got a lot of interest from some major web properties so it’s soon going to start getting harder to change the pieces that have shipped already.
