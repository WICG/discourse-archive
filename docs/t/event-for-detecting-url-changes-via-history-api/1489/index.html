<p>The History API currently provides a popstate event for detecting navigations via browser controls in a single-page application but Iâ€™m not aware of a clean way to listen for changes to the URL as a result of uses of <code>history.{pushState|replaceState}</code>.</p>
<p>My use case is for reacting to URL changes in a 3rd-party widget embedded in a page which displays content related to the current URL, specifically the <a href="https://github.com/hypothesis/h" rel="nofollow noopener">Hypothesis</a> tool for annotating web pages. Some additional use cases described at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/4570093/434243" rel="nofollow noopener">http://stackoverflow.com/q/4570093/434243</a> include browser extensions. In both cases the top-level document may not be aware of the 3rd-pary widget so it has not been architected to push changes to it (eg. via an attribute on the widget or calling some function on a controller provided by the widget).</p>
<p>Perhaps this could take the form of a <code>locationchange</code> event which is fired whenever the URL changes for any reason or a <code>pushstate</code> event which is triggered only when <code>history.replaceState</code> or <code>history.pushState</code> are used. Thoughts?</p>

<p>I think what you want is a <code>StateChanged</code> event which behaves similar to <code>PopState</code> event but for all backward, forward, an in-place modifications of the history state stack. This can be useful when you want to observer URL changes but also in a more general case of observing any page state modifications. It may even be better to have a state mutation observer instead of an event.</p>
<p>As pointed out in the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/25673946" rel="nofollow noopener">linked stack overflow discussion</a>, this may be achieved by monkey-patching the history object. I am not sure if this is possible on all browsers and for it to work the monkey patching should occur before the page has a chance to hold a private reference to the history object.</p>

<p>FWIW, this is anecdotal but some popular routing libraries provide a similar hook (e.g., ReactRouter has <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/API.md#onupdate" rel="nofollow noopener"><code>onUpdate</code></a>)  which also indicate that there is some need for it.</p>
