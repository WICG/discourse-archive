<p>It would be great if in addition to being able to <a href="https://wicg.github.io/directory-upload/proposal.html" rel="nofollow noopener">access folders</a>, web apps could also save folders. This would eliminate the need for folders to be zipped, downloaded, and unzipped, which is particularly ridiculous when the folder is stored someplace like a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/filesystem-api/" rel="nofollow noopener">local sandboxed file system</a>. It would also be consistent with user expectations, as things like Google Drive allow folders to be uploaded but downloads are zipped.</p>

<p>Like I said <a href="//discourse.wicg.io/t/resurrecting-the-file-system-api/842">back in May when we were talking about upload</a>, it’d be nice if the File System API were un-deprecated and developed for non-Chrome browsers (or, better, replaced with a less-verbose Promise-based version). It’s completely reasonable for a website to want to operate on a directory of files (eg. a mod manager for a computer game like <a href="https://moddingofisaac.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://moddingofisaac.com/</a>), and forcing them to operate within a browser-dictated sandbox makes filesystem access more or less useless.</p>
