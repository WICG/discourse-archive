<p>In my <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/maps/supporting-material-uploads/presentations/Thijs_Brentjens/fuzzy-geolocation/">presentation on Fuzzy geolocation</a> in the context of privacy/security, I invited everyone to respond to this concept and share ideas. I hope we can explore that further during this workshop. So please feel free to respond to this topic.</p>
<p>What are your ideas about privacy and security risks (when sending the user’s precise geolocation / area of interest to third-party services)? What do you think of the proposed approach to add fuzziness? Do you have other ideas and/or views to share? Or what kind of (new) issues could be introduced by this approach?</p>
<p>Let’s discuss that here.</p>
<p>Geonovum will also use this topic to give updates on a proof of concept we are going to develop that illustrates the concept.</p>

<p>Here are some comments from workshop participants who watched it live:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Peter Rushforth <span class="mention">@prushforth</span>:
<span class="mention">@thijsbrentjens</span> private mode map browsing is a vital necessity for a public Web imho</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SebastienDurand <span class="mention">@SebastienDurand</span>:
There was a lot of applications that was created under COVID in Canada that were never published because there was a lack in confidence on the process used to ensure geolocation privacy, this is indeed a requirements and a concern and was found to be a bottleneck in the COVID response and monitoring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SebastienDurand <span class="mention">@SebastienDurand</span>:
What is the path <span class="mention">@thjsbrentjens</span> recommends to see this done? Should there be an OGC geolocation privacy/fuzzy api?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peter Rushforth <span class="mention">@prushforth</span>:
<span class="mention">@thijsbrentjens</span> A “user” agent should provide a private map browsing mode!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bryan Haberberger <span class="mention">@thehabes</span>:
I like how this lives in the realm of computer ethics too. Fuzzy location to alleviate some ethical concerns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>вкαя∂εℓℓ <span class="mention">@briankardell</span>:
it feels like this could be more easily specified for a larger element than at another level? The UA can moderate the delta between granularity</p>

<p>PS, Thijs: are you able to edit to add the <a href="https://discourse.wicg.io/c/web-mapping/22">web mapping</a> tag as well, so it shows up there, in addition to in the security category?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="mention">@AmeliaBR</span> , good idea (sorry I didn’t do that right away), but I can’t find where to edit an existing topic. Do you know where to find that?</p>

<p>There should be a pencil icon at the bottom of your post. I was able to edit one of mine to add the correct category later, although I’m not sure if it’s possible to add multiple categories.</p>

<p>This talk opened my eyes to some of the privacy concerns, thank you for the concise explanation. I was wondering if anyone had ideas for fuzzy geolocation in combination with things like (gazetteer) search, as it seems like privacy is also necessary in this regard.</p>
