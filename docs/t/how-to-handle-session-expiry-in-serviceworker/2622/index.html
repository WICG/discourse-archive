<p>If a Fetch in my ServiceWorker receives a 401 from the server how do I
re-authenticate with the server if I have no focused or foregrounded client?</p>
<p>NB: I’m talking about POST requests updating the server and not just
reading from cache until the network is back.</p>
<p>Bring the client back into focus? Scary for user with no action causing
that reaction and they may not be there to login again anyway.</p>
<p>What does Background-Synch do if it gets a 401?</p>
<p>If navigator.credentials was surfaced in a ServiceWorker that would be
enough!</p>
<p>Sessions that never expire?</p>
<p>What are other people doing?</p>
<p>Yet again I’m banned from W3C/IETF Github <img alt=":frowning:" class="emoji" src="//discourse.wicg.io/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:"/></p>

<p>If a User Session has expired a ServiceWorker currently has no mechanisms
available to re-authenticate with the server as there is no heuristic
mechanism available for determining credentials.</p>
<p>If the credentials.get() was available then re-authentication could take
place transparently. If federated (say Google) then if the user had logged
out then that state would be honoured.</p>
<p>The idea has some support from the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/1231" rel="nofollow noopener">ServiceWorker</a> people</p>
