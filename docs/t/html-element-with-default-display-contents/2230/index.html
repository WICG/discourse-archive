<p><code>display: contents</code> does not have widespread support yet. I imagine once it is widely supported, it will be used quite frequently. As such, it is logical that there exists an element that defaults to it, the same was <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> default to <code>display: inline</code> and <code>display: block</code> respectively.</p>
<p>What I’m proposing is essentially the equivalent of <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. I’m not sure what the name should be ─ my initial thought was <code>&lt;contents&gt;</code>, but that was previously used. However, it would not be unprecedented to deprecate and element and later reimplement it (I can’t recall the element, but this has happened once before).</p>
<p>Hopefully this will receive some consideration.</p>

<p>New elements shouldn’t represent merely a specific styling but should have semantic meaning in and of itself. While this has not historically always been true it definitely is for any new elements.</p>

<p>I agree, but anything along the lines of <code>&lt;span class='contents'&gt;</code> along with <code>.contents { display: contents; }</code> certainly has little to no semantic meaning. Aria tags would likely help, but few developers even do this.</p>
<p>It certainly seems like the typical use case for <code>display: contents</code> would be to group elements together when a new parent is not actually needed. In my opinion, this would certainly constitute greater semantic meaning than a CSS class.</p>

<p>The way to get new elements is to have a use-case, show current methods to get what you want or get close, and show why it is important a new element be introduced to solve this purpose. Even better now that Web Components exist, make a polyfill of the element so it can be played with an explored.</p>
<p>Simply asking for an element because you want some CSS property to get used more won’t go anywhere. That provides no reason to drive browser developers to implement a new element.</p>
<p>If you feel so strongly about the new property, instead of asking for an element to try and get people to use it, evangelize it. Write a blog post. Look into conversations on different networks and chime in when you see a problem where the property solves the case. Write to newsletters and let them know your blog post exists and ask to get included in a future letter to subscribers.</p>

<p>My use case is for React containers. Every React component tree needs to be rendered into some kind of container element, so we often create an empty <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> for this purpose. But maybe the React components themselves are <code>inline-block</code> and shouldn’t create a block-level element, so I find it’s best to add <code>display:contents</code> to this container so that the React component can control the flow instead of the container.</p>
<p>This isn’t hard to do, but neither <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> nor <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> feels right for this purpose because neither traditionally has this flow. It might improve HTML readability if you knew what the element was doing by default.</p>

<p>React supports fragments via <code>React.Fragment</code>/<code>&lt;&gt;...&lt;/&gt;</code>, nullifying this use case.</p>
<p>Separately, I do have a proposal specifically with frameworks in mind, to provide a more direct variant that is intentionally <em>not</em> visible to CSS: <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-live-fragments/2507">Proposal: Live fragments</a></p>
