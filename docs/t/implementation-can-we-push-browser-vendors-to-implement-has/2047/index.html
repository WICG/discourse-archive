<p>For those that don’t know, here is the spec for <code>:has()</code>, per the CSSWG:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The relational pseudo-class, :has(), is a functional pseudo-class taking a relative selector list as an argument. It represents an element if any of the relative selectors, when absolutized and evaluated with the element as the :scope elements, would match at least one element.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To my knowledge, this is not being actively worked on by any vendor. No doubt, this single selector complicates CSS by a mile implementation-wise. However, the implementation of such a selector would be widespread, as most experienced developers could attest.</p>
<p>Hopefully you all agree that this is a very powerful selector, and should be implemented.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the <code>:has()</code> selector is almost useless since it’s supposed to be available in JS only, not in CSS. That’s probably one of reasons why it has not much implementors’ interest — web developers just don’t need it in its current state.</p>

<p>I was under the interpretation that it was going to be in CSS as well as a level 4 module. If that’s not the case, then disregard this post.</p>
<p>Having it in JS would still be useful, but not as useful as CSS.</p>

<p>See the spec section about dynamic and static <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#profiles" rel="nofollow noopener">profiles</a>. The dynamic (CSS) profile explicitly excludes <code>:has()</code> unlike the static (JS) profile.</p>
<p>In JS we are already able to implement similar functionality since JS is fortunately a programming language. To be fair, having <code>:has()</code> in JS would indeed allow to make our JS code somewhat less verbose by avoiding extra <code>querySelector()</code> calls for the purpose of testing whether an element contains something matching a selector that we could use as an argument for <code>:has()</code>.</p>

<p>Interesting, I’d never heard of that. So basically it’ll be implemented in JS and not vanilla CSS? This would still be something worth pursuing from vendors, in my opinion.</p>

</aside>
<p>Agreed, the thought of having something like <code>:has()</code> available in CSS was a blissful thought, but even if it’s only going to be implemented in JS, it still is useful in many cases and worth the fight.</p>
