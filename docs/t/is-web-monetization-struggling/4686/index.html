<p>Short answer, No. In fact the volume of payments we’re seeing from Coil and the number of monetized sites is constantly increasing.</p>
<p>To bootstrap the WM ecosystem Coil had a commercial agreement with Stronghold to host receiving accounts for Web Monetization. Since then two new wallets have joined the ecosystem <a href="https://gatehub.net" rel="nofollow noopener">Gatehub</a> and <a href="https://uphold.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Uphold</a>, both of whom are better suited to this function as they are consumer facing wallets (Stronghold has more of a B2B focus).</p>
<p>I can’t speak for Stronghold but they may choose to continue being part of the Interledger ecosystem and focus on B2B use cases.</p>

<p>I didn’t know about Web Monetization until I saw this post…</p>
<p>For now it seems like a sort of donation of arbitrary amount to Coil that is then automatically split among the different websites visited by the user. Is that right?</p>
<p>I think it would be much more useful to <strong>simplify micro-payments on the web</strong> and let websites decide how much to charge for a specific action / view of content.</p>

<p>I agree. Having no clear way to specify amounts for the user makes it tricky to know what to enable for the user.</p>

</aside>
<p>Not quite. Users pay Coil a fixed monthly subscription and Coil’s model is to distribute that among the sites the user visits. Coil’s goal (in this case) is to not require the user to think about paying each site they visit and to make that decision for them.</p>
<p>However, that is just the start. With the payment infrastructure now place (i.e. Coil can send payments on behalf of users and websites are setup to receive) it is possible for Coil to add new features like explicit donations and digital goods purchases.</p>
<p>Other providers (Coil competitors) could adopt an entirely different model if they choose. All that the standard defines is a way for websites to declare HOW they can be paid and an API to watch for incoming payments so the website can respond to these.</p>
<p>The goal is to continue building on this infrastructure and use existing APIs like Payment Request to improve the ways websites can request payment and support new use case.</p>
<p>Have a look at <a href="https://community.webmonetization.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://community.webmonetization.org</a> to see some of the experiments being done already.</p>
