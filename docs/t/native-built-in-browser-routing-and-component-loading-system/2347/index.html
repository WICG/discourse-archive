<p>There are sooooo many JS frameworks to do single-page applications (SPAs). And a huge portion of what these frameworks provide is the routing system because developers need a way to load pages and their components without reloading the entire the page and DOM state everytime a user clicks around on the website.</p>
<p>But if browsers implement native routing support for SPAs, we can at least begin to standardize a large chunk of building SPAs. Here’s a naive featureset of things that I think could be provided with a natively-supported routing and loading system, much of which are already implemented by current frameworks today.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Global Configuration - to specify app-level settings using the manifest.json file for example. Maybe a new <code>display</code> attribute of <code>single-page-application</code> or something similar which would put the application in “spa mode”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Route configuration - to specify path references to the components to load when certain URLs are requested and any dependencies. This can be a separate file that sits at the root of the application similar to manifest.json or maybe even inside of the manifest file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handle in-app page requests - When a user requests a new relative url (by clicking an internal link for example), based on the route config above, the browser would determine whether the url request should be loaded in the current DOM (spa link) or not. And if the former, load the contents in the DOM without a full page reload</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamically load requested pages along with any nested components specified in the route configuration above. I also think this would eliminate all the chaos and controversy around importing html modules because, with the right configurations used above, it’s likely they could no longer be necessary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously this is a very small list of things an SPA routing/loading system could provide and the specifics and implementation details can be changed but I’m curious to get your thoughts on the overall idea.</p>

<p>In the spirit of the extensible web manifesto, it’d probably be best if the standard solution was based on existing libraries for client-side routing that have proven to work well. I personally use the <code>&lt;Router&gt;</code> component in Preact, so I guess a standard <code>&lt;router&gt;</code> element is an option. A “use cases and requirements” spec would help.</p>

<p>I like that idea. Previous attempts at providing better high-level abstractions to create the “single page app” model failed to get traction (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/jakearchibald/navigation-transitions">Navigation Transitions</a>. Maybe it was because they tried to extend the concept of navigation (so forcing multiple pages to behave like a single page app, which is rather complex) rather than embracing the single page parts, but making them easier (and require less JS).</p>
<p>I think that before diving into the solution, it’ll be great to state the goals and detailed use cases. (as <span class="mention">@simevidas</span> mentioned)</p>

<p>I have a feeling that Service Workers will be disrupting a lot around what we used to traditionally think around SPAs. As it is a fully client-side JS router that we can use to intercept requests, even creating entirely fabricated responses which can come asynchronously from other sources.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is also time to disassemble the heart of an SPA, because it might mean that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why can’t all these windows and tabs be part of the very same application, talking via postMessage &amp; Service Worker, unified to the same database?</li>
<li>Would each window simply be a new perspective and view of the same app?</li>
<li>Would we be going in the direction to something similar akin to our web version of Electron?</li>

<p><span class="mention">@Malvoz</span> I did check the explainer. Portals sound awesome but they seem a little different from what I was proposing. Portals make it possible for you to have inset pages that can be loaded from different domains, which just seems like iframes–just a little more seamless. What I meant by my original statement was to make it possible to fully replace areas of the document with new HTML that contains parts can be reused throughout each of the pages. Based on what I read on the explainer, portal insets don’t allow you to reuse the HTML from other insets.</p>

</aside>
<p>In general do not use any third party “framework” library code, here. Try to use only code shipped with the browser.</p>
<p>Therefore since there is no “router” shipped with the browser it would be helpful to clearly define what that term means <em>to you</em>, instead of presuming that all developers use or have used some third-party framework or library to achieve requirements that are possible using the code shipped with the browser. Individuals tend to have very different internal interpretations of words and terms that another individual might not be aware of or reject altogether as a viable meaning of a term. Thus, definitions of the terms relied upon <em>by the author</em> is helpful to determine if there is consensus or contention as to the origin and varied usage of that term, as English is an equivocal language capable of more than one meaning for a single word or phrase.</p>
<p><code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element and JavaScript modules and CSS and <code>ServiceWorker</code> shipped with the browser should be able to achieve the requirement “load pages and their components without reloading the entire the page and DOM state everytime a user clicks around on the website.”</p>

<p>A <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element or CSS or ServiceWorker have nothing to do with what I’m proposing.

<p>I never said that I can’t do what I’m proposing using existing browser APIs, so I don’t know where you’re getting that from. Again, <em>please</em> look at router-component library that I posted earlier. It is not using a framework at all. It is using what is natively available in browsers using existing APIs. But it is not easy to do and developers have to reinvent and maintain this same “routing” logic similar to the router-component library everytime a new single page application is created.

<p>I’m not sure what you are trying to say here.  Perhaps just what <span class="mention">@yoavweiss</span>  anId <span class="mention">@simevidas</span> said?  There’s definitely not a problem talking about the fact that client side routing exists, is non-trivial, and is an important part of just about every SPA approach.   If popular client side solutions exist, it would seem that by definition it is possible using what we have today, but I believe that the point is that today this requires quite a bit of complexity.  It <em>could</em> be that some new primitive would help here, but it seems more likely that what is being asked for is simply a higher level way to orchestrate existing things to do what all (or most of) what those libraries and frameworks do.  The question though is definitely ‘which things’ and for which specific use cases, since they really aren’t the exactly all solving exactly the same problems in the same ways.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@mkay581</span> An explainer which defined specifically the aims and non-aims, with more detailed use cases and so on would be helpful… in that it seems to me appropriate to discuss or link to a kind of survey of existing routers/features/functionality in the ecosystem.</p>

<p>Perhaps do not gather what this site is about. Was under impression that proposals here were for  what is not ccurrently possible.

<p>Would suggest clearly defining “routing” and creating an example of needing to reload the document to achieve loading a component, as mentioned at this proposal. Good luck.</p>

<p>If the proposal is to formalize what has been achieved in code at linked repository as a specification, then that should be stated at the outset.</p>
<p>What is the problem: code example.
What is the solution: code example.
What is the formal procedure to solve: specification.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is the source of confusion… Not only, no. Many APIs do not grant fundamental new capabilities. Higher level APIs are definitely welcome and important. ‘paving cowpaths’ is definitely ultimately a goal. If lots of the ecosystem is solving and resolving the same problems over and over again, that is definitely a great candidate to think about finding some standards around. The goal here is to be a welcoming place for early discussion and see where we can find agreement/help sketch out ideas with the larger community to see if there is something here which can be incubated in the hopes of possible standardization.</p>
<p>Several people have suggested that this is a potentially interesting idea (welcoming, I think), and that what would be good now would be an explainer, with use-cases and requirements which survey the existing landscape of solutions (of which there are many). The aim would be to describe how such a thing would change this (ie, does this aim to simply replace all of those? some of them? Does it aim to solve completely only for more trivial uses and does this also make the jobs of existing solutions more trivial by sitting between a bunch of complex stuff somehow?)</p>
