<p>It turns out that gzip-style string-table compression means there’s
really no difference in transmission data.</p>
<p>For browser memory, the DOM is so vast that a two-character difference
is insignificant.</p>
<p>For disk storage uncompressed on a server, a single image file would
dwarf any savings you could make.</p>
<p>A document with, say, ten thousand div elements, would save four octets
(in start and end tags) for each of them, so 40,000 bytes - but a
document with only a single paragraph of text per div would be tens of
megabytes in size. I have such a document in fact: a 32-volume
encyclopedia of biography, and it’s about 50 MBytes in XML; i use XSLT
to make a static Web site with one file, one Web resource, for each of
the approx. 10,000 entries, however [1]. You shouldn’t normally be
serving up HTML files with 10,000 div elements in them.</p>
<p>This would be optimizing for an inappropriate use case.</p>

<p>Well, dotless i (ı) has fewer pixels, isn’t that even better <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="//discourse.wicg.io/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:"/> <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="//discourse.wicg.io/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>
<p>Less flippantly, it’d be a far bigger win to use server-side parsing
and parse-event streams [2], and existing Web pages could then benefit
simply by updating Web servers.</p>

the “XML” in the name of this compression technique; server-side
parsing works for pretty much anything)</p>

<p>There are certainly benefits to brevity. Otherwise, we’d have a <code>&lt;division&gt;</code> element rather than a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. Even if these benefits amount only to fewer keystrokes, shorter line-lengths, and marginally smaller files on disk, I thought it was worth a discussion. A byte saved is a byte saved. There is a reason why we minify our files.</p>
<p>I do think that introducing a brand new element is quite a major change for such a minor optimization. However, if we were starting all over again, would we really prefer a three-character non-semantic name over a one-character non-semantic name?</p>

<p>The HTML spec does some things like this because the single page edition is really really giant and browsers expand the zip before parsing, it can matter, I guess.</p>
<p>That said, what they use are custom elements like  where f is a Boolean attribute and these are for marking up code formatting examples which quickly pile up a huge amount to parse, store and even then read if you’re looking at DOM, I guess. Anyways, I’d suggest like this: convince people to do one, we’ll see it in the http archive reports and can reevaluate… It already means approximately span.</p>

<p>In HTML email, files size is generally limited to 100kb (larger files will be clipped by Gmail and likely to raise spam scores across a number of client). So for email devs every character really counts.  Although I realise that is niche and may not be so much of a priority for web.</p>

<p>I’d say that’s pretty niche. And most likely, you won’t be saving even 0.1% of that by changing your <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s to <code>&lt;e&gt;</code>s, even pre-compression.</p>
