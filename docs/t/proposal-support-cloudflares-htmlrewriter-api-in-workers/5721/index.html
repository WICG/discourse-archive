<p>Cloudflare Workers based their API on the Service Worker API.</p>
<p>But Cloudflare found it quite useful to enhance that API with an <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/html-rewriter" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">HTMLRewriter api</a>.</p>
<p>It is possible to implement the API in a <a href="https://github.com/worker-tools/parsed-html-rewriter" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">service worker</a> but it is quite costly and limited in scope (no streaming support, for example).</p>
<p>This is a proposal to incorporate that API (more or less) into the platform so it can be used from workers (as well as from outside workers, I guess), including streaming support.</p>

<p>Just to add a little more justification:</p>
<p>The need has been stated eloquently by others.  For example:  <a href="https://paul.kinlan.me/we-need-dom-apis-in-workers/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">We need DOM APIs in Workers - Modern Web Development with Chrome by Paul Kinlan</a>.</p>
<p>Cloudflare has a strong interest in supporting the most helpful api it can provide within the tight constraints it needs to impose as far as memory usage / cpu utlization.  This is what they came up with.  I think the same findings would likely hold in a browser setting, especially on a resource-limited mobile phone.</p>
<p>I’ve faced scenarios where I wanted to implement functionality (such as providing link preview functionality) in workers, but abandoned it due to the lack of a parser.</p>
<p>Another use case – integrating data that is in indexedDB or other worker accessible locations into a server-rendered stream.</p>
<p>Being that we are encouraged to take processing off the main thread, lack of some way of parsing HTML has been a significant barrier for me.</p>
<p>From my explorations of the HTMLRewriter api, I believe it does provide sufficient hooks to implement a  DOM Parser of sorts (maybe without css query capabilities) in a fairly straightforward way, with a fairly small download footprint (at the expense of the performance toll on memory this would entail, which Cloudflare steers clear from).  Perhaps if the need for such a DOM Parser is really required, it could build on the HTMLRewriter down the road, once a good implementation is proven out.</p>

<p>Update.  There is now a <a href="https://github.com/worker-tools/html-rewriter" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">wasm-based custom solution, that supports streaming</a>.  Haven’t tried it yet.</p>
