<p>Despite the variety of performance measurements available through the current API, it’s difficult to discern from the NavigationType whether the measurements reflect those of a regular navigation under normal browsing or of one where the browser is in a non-optimal performance state, such as a cold start. A browser launch is one of the most expensive performance scenarios commonly encountered in typical PWA and WebView patterns. Our proposal seeks to create a new value for the NavigationType enum to differentiate this condition from others in measurements of web application performance.</p>
<p>Modifying the NavigationType to include state for a user agent launch (i.e. useragent_launch) will enable engineers to determine whether a given measurement is taken from a launch scenario, enabling greater differentiation of application performance from browser performance in scenarios where the browser engine is launched and terminated frequently. Examples include: Electron apps, system WebViews, or other application scenarios where the browser is relatively short-lived or commonly launched from a terminated state.</p>

<p>Please take a look at <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://github.com/w3c/navigation-timing/issues/179" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Detecting whether a navigation was BFCache-eligible · Issue #179 · w3c/navigation-timing · GitHub</a> . TL;DR it is not possible to tell whether the page load was eligible for BFCache or not. I hope a common solution is possible or at least that the eventual solution bears the BFCache case in mind.</p>
<p>What is the reason to add a new type and change some existing behaviour, vs adding a new field or fields to record how the page was launched?</p>
<p>Since this proposal is concerned with whether the launch was at a time of resource competition, wouldn’t you want to distinguish between</p>
<ul>
<li>a browser cold start</li>
<li>a restore as part of profile launch</li>
<li>restore of a tab</li>
<li>clone of a tab</li>
<li>restore of a large group of tabs
