<p>The web is growing, and so are the number of properties and property values found in a style sheet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Style sheets have 3D transforms, which don’t apply to SVGElements.</li>
<li>Style sheets have stroke, which don’t apply to HTMLElements.</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of adding new functionality into a single class of stylesheet for all Elements, maybe it would be better to have subclasses of stylesheets for use by different types of elements including custom elements.</p>
<p>This way, when we look at computed styles for an SVGElement we won’t see unrelated stuff for HTMLElements, etc.</p>
<p>Suppose later the web gains Elements for defining 3D GL scenes, <code>HTML3DElement</code>s or something. It will get messy to just add more CSS properties into a single class of sheet.</p>

<p>I find CSS * SVG to be really frustrating, and agree there’s a better way.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the web <em>needs</em> a standardized content editor that handles <em>all</em> types of content.  Essentially a WYSIWYG, that’s actually “WYSIWYG”, and handles layouts, CSS, SVG, etc.</p>
<p>It needs to have version control built in.  It needs to be customizable (like in Photoshop, you can adjust your toolbars).  It needs to be extendable (so I could write my own “pen tool”).</p>
<p>That’s a big challenge, no doubt.  But how much time would be saved (collectively) if we could just design in-browser, and not have to worry about vendor prefixes, or CSS preprocessors, or SVG vs HTML properties…</p>
<p>Shouldn’t content creation be fast, easy, fun?</p>
<p>Not only would this be the greatest thing the internet has ever seen, but the quality of content (from email, to wikipedia, to every website) would skyrocket.  And, if <em>someone</em> figured out how to do it, they might be able to make a lot of money.  How much could you make if you had the best content platform in the world?</p>

<p>Well, to put it in perspective, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/08/new-sequoia-china-investment-values-australian-design-company-canva-at-1-billion" rel="nofollow noopener">Canva is valued at $1 billion</a>, and let’s put it this way: Canva is probably nowhere near the most-awesome type of creation studio that you’d imagine…</p>
<p>But anyway, that wasn’t the topic of this thread, although I can’t help but like to discuss anything that can make the web better! <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="//discourse.wicg.io/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>
