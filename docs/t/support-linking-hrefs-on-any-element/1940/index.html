<p>It should be possible to turn any element into a link, either by giving it an href attribute or some other method.</p>
<p>Wrapping in an anchor is not sufficient for elements such as table rows that cannot be legally placed inside an anchor element.</p>
<p>Using JS is not sufficient as pseudo-links do not provide all necessary functionality, such as a context menu with “open in new tab / window” options. They also break if JS is disabled.</p>

<p>FWIW, the (discontinued) XHTML 2.0 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/mod-hyperAttributes.html#adef_hyperAttributes_href">allowed</a> the <code>href</code> attribute to be global.</p>
<p>IIRC, the feature has also been proposed for HTML5 or even included in some of earliest HTML5-spec versions, but in the end it has been rejected on the ground of backward incompatibility.</p>
<p>It’s been almost 10 years since then, and browsers have adopted the rapid-release paradigm long ago, so backward compatibility is now probably not a critical issue (if really was at all), and this could probably reconsidered.</p>

<p>Nothing, technically. But if SVG’s proposed <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, etc. elements come through, they already would use <code>href</code> instead of <code>src</code>. (Like how <code>&lt;image href&gt;</code> is already <code>&lt;img src&gt;</code>.)</p>

<p>Having created many, many such tables in web apps I can assure you it <em>is</em> needed.</p>
<p>First there is the table-cell layout nightmare that MT mentions. And then there is the performance question. Imagine I have a data-bound table in a web app with 1000 rows and 20 columns (it could easily be bigger). It’s the difference between adding an href attribute on 1000 rows, versus creating 20,000 data-bound anchor elements, with all the JS, parsing and layout work that involves in the browser.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don’t understand how there can be any objection to making linking easier and more powerful. Links and URLs are the web’s killer feature. They are the one thing that native apps cannot do. So why is the actual markup support for them so limited? We’re basically stuck with what we had in 1994.</p>

<p>IIRC, someone responsible to make decisions believed long ago that making the <code>href</code> attribute global would break the web because older user agents would be unable to recognize such links. This is probably not true anymore given that browsers are updated frequently and automatically today (except for ones made by MS).</p>

<p>To address your scenario, I meant that having <em>one anchor</em> per row (in the row’s primary cell) should be fine. I’m not even sure that having the entire row act as an anchor is a good UI pattern to begin with. Users expect to interact with links and form controls <em>inside</em> cells, I think.</p>

<p>I think we’d be better off having direct discussions on what to add <code>href</code> to instead of “just make it global”. It certainly doesn’t belong on, <code>body</code>, <code>header</code>, <code>footer</code>, <code>aside</code>, <code>figure</code>, <code>figcaption</code>, <code>canvas</code>, <code>video</code>, <code>audio</code>, <code>ul</code>, <code>ol</code>, <code>dl</code>, etc. There are numerous cases where allowing href against the whole thing would be maddening.</p>
<p>Personally, table rows as anchors is also a horrid pattern. It makes selecting/copying content within the table extremely difficult at times. However, there are places where this could be useful, so perhaps allowing href on <code>tr</code> to start would be a good start. Further cases on allowing it on other elements can be discussed on an as-needed basis around the use-cases relevant to that particular element.</p>
<p>It could be a BC concern. As your site would work in some browsers but not in others. And using JS to detect this and make things work in older engines wouldn’t be easy. You’d essentially rely on browser detection instead of feature detection which has been discouraged for a good time now.</p>

<p>Allowing <code>href</code> on any element is long past doable, not least because of the SVG issues <span class="mention">@Tigt</span> mentioned. However the table case in particular stands out as being an issue and I have to agree with <span class="mention">@amtiskaw</span> that some sort of fix is needed.</p>
<p>My ideal scenario would be that an <code>a</code> could wrap a <code>tr</code>, <code>td</code> or <code>th</code> but there’s no way to make such a major change to HTML parsing at this point. On that basis I would say there’s a good argument to allow <code>href</code> on those elements specifically.</p>
<p>There are several big problems that need to be solved though going in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nesting. Currently it is impossible to nest <code>a</code> tags, browsers will close one <code>a</code> before the next one starts. What happens if there is an <code>a</code> in a <code>tr</code> with an <code>href</code>? Does the inner one get ignored? Pushed out after the row? Do we allow this, if so what impact will this have on usability and assistive technology?</li>
<li>CSS styling. Do the <code>:link</code> and related psuedo-classes also now get to apply to <code>tr</code> and other allowed elements? If not how do we target linkable elements?</li>
<li>How best can we future proof it so that if more elements are added to those allowed to use <code>href</code> as a link we don’t need to re-answer these questions</li>

<p>I can think of several where it doesn’t make sense. Anything with existing interaction semantics for a start. What happens when I click on <code>&lt;input type="checkbox" href="www.google.com" name="example" /&gt;</code> does it navigate to Google or does it toggle the state of the checkbox?

<p>This isn’t a usecase. A usecase is a specific example. Also considering that this is a huge change they should be compelling usecases where using an <code>a</code> in a well structured document would not provide a solution. The table case is currently the only one I can think of.</p>

<p>So, <code>video</code> and <code>audio</code> which provide controls to the player should actually link to external pages instead when clicked on? That is an extremely confusing user experience to allow for so trivially.</p>
<p>Why would <code>figure</code> and <code>figcaption</code> in any way be links themselves? That goes completely against their semantic reasons for existing.</p>
<p>Why would you have <em>entire sectional elements</em> (<code>header</code>, <code>footer</code>, <code>article</code>, <code>aside</code>, <code>section</code>, <code>ol</code>, <code>ul</code>) be links out to external content? These things should contain links within them, not be them.</p>
<p>The philosophy of having a loose experience for developers to build is very beneficial. However, I do think there is a line where vendors need to consider solid use-cases for changes that change how things have worked for a very long time. Allowing <code>href</code> on just “anything” could be extremely detrimental overall. Being open to <em>individual element</em> changes should absolutely be possible. But, saying there is one use-case in one element to have it therefore someone must have good use-cases for every other element that exists isn’t a good way to go about making change.</p>

<p>I’m proposing a function that you can pass either an element for a one off test or a tagname to see if that tag supports linking. Eg <code>navigator.allowLinkOn("a")</code>, <code>navigator.allowLinkOn("area")</code> and in this case <code>navigator.allowLinkOn("tr")</code> would all return true, whereas <code>navigator.allowLinkOn("footer")</code> would be false. I’d also say it should allow <code>navigator.allowLinkOn(element)</code> for a one off test case too.</p>
<p>This supports individual changes just as well but would be simpler than creating an element just to test that. It also means testing for the single navigator function means you know if you’re in classic or brave-new-world linking.</p>

<p>Indeed, interactive elements like <code>INPUT</code> could be excluded on the spec level from those the <code>href</code> attribute is allowed to use with.</p>
<p>Basically, we could disallow using the <code>href</code> attribute with elements that regular links cannot currently be placed inside while being functional (clickable), except for elements like <code>LINK</code> that already have <code>href</code> attribute allowed.</p>

<p>Why would you have entire sectional elements (header, footer, article, aside, section, ol, ul) be links out to external content? These things should contain links within them, not be them.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s probably a question to those allowed <code>A</code> to contain block-level elements (incl. sectioning ones) in HTML5.</p>
<p>The usecase is to make a semantically marked-up block (e. g. corresponding to an item in an internet store) which is entirely a link to make it easier to click or tap it without the need for aiming precisely a small clickable part of the block. Before this has been standardized, those caring about validity have been forced to use a bunch of nested unsemantic <code>SPAN</code> elements instead of proper structural markup.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There could be many edgecases, each needs to be noted and considered for its impact. A breaking change to something as fundamental as links needs to be done carefully with as small a footprint as possible if you want any hope it gets looked at by the browsers. This proposal needs to be explicit about which elements get it added, not which get excluded. Each proposed additional element can then have the merits and problems discussed independently.</p>

<p>A test case and a use case are fundamentally different. Your previous “use case” was “Usecases are obviously the same as for regular links” in which case the response is going to be “well just use a regular link then”. Your usecase needs to be a concrete example of where the change would provide notable improvement to developers or the platform as a whole. Simply getting to drop an element on a document does not come close.</p>
<p>A usecase for allowing <code>tr</code> would be</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>Allowing a full table row to link through to another page is a common pattern (for example a table listing various features of related products where clicking takes a user to an order page). While it can be argued that there should be a single link in one of the table cells for navigating to the product this is not a clearly superior UX pattern and there are strong arguments that the table row about the element is the appropriate element to be this link.</p>
<p>Currently this is not possible due to the limitations on <code>a</code> and <code>tr</code>. The closest we could manage would be to wrap the contents on each cell in an <code>a</code>, however padding and spacing between cells would not be clickable, it would also have a negative impact on keyboard browsing and screen readers having multiple links to go through. Alternatively we can use JS to set on <code>onclick</code> event for the row but this is making a fundamental interaction dependant on JS and would again have issues on accessibility.</p>
<p>Allowing <code>href</code> on <code>tr</code> to allow the whole row to be a link would enable developers to use this UX pattern and get full support from browsers to treat it as a first-class link as with <code>a</code> and <code>area</code> and we can use JS to polyfill older browsers</p>

<p>It’s a bit long-winded but I wanted to clearly show the points you need to be making.</p>
