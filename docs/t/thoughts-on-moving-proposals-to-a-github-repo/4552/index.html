<p>The chairs have <a href="https://github.com/WICG/admin/issues/120">been wondering</a> if it would make sense to move the proposal process from here to GitHub.</p>
<p>I’d like to gather thoughts from y’all on that front: Are you more likely to propose and provide feedback on other proposals over on Github? Less likely? Same?</p>
<p>Please chime in! <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="//discourse.wicg.io/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

<p>I like the idea of having a low-friction space to informally discuss early stage ideas.</p>
<p>It’s not really clear what “move to GitHub” really means. Will it use their new ‘Discussions’ feature? Do we file issues for proposals? Do we have to make a PR? If the latter I think that would add too much friction to the process. It should be like a simple forum where you have a decent chance of getting good comments from passers-by.</p>

<p>To me, they are currently very different things with different qualities - I’m not sure I can provide an honest answer.  I will personally participate in approximately the same way whether this is on gh, or a mailing list, or over here - but the discourse wasn’t about me it was about separating expectations and having a noisy and very open channel that is designed to serve that kind of need -gives you the tools for discussion, discoverability, search, thematic tagging, subscription, administration and so on.  It’s possible, I suppose to achieve many of the same things via gh, but it changes several aspects of the equation too, so idk.</p>

<p>Yes, please. Easier to cross-reference and perform cross-repo searches, and no need to repeat everything when a proposal “graduates” from incubation to a formal proposals.</p>
