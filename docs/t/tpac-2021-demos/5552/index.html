<p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>As in previous years [1], as part of TPAC, Marie-Claire Forgue and I are
calling for W3C groups to produce short videos to share updates from
your group’s work and/or technical demos illustrating the latest
developments in your groups that would benefit from being shared with
the broader W3C community. These videos can also serve as background
material for some of the TPAC breakouts and group meetings.</p>
<p>If someone in your group is willing to record such a video, please
contact us with the name of the volunteer by September 15 (sooner is
better); for demos, we will also want a proposed title of the demo and
ideally a description of what the demo will be about. We would then
expect to receive the recorded videos by September 27th for publication
after post-processing around October 1st.</p>
<p>Based on the experience from last year, we’ve built a collection of best
practices to help build impactful videos (esp. demos):</p>
<p><a class="onebox" href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/TPAC2021/Demos_and_Group_updates#Best_Practices_for_Recording_Videos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.w3.org/wiki/TPAC2021/Demos_and_Group_updates#Best_Practices_for_Recording_Videos</a></p>
<p>We’re also happy to receive suggestion for additional best practices
that you think would help improve this effort.</p>
<p>Many thanks for your contributions in bringing more exposure to the
import work your groups are pushing forward!</p>
<p>Dom</p>
