<p>I would like to draw your attention to the recently re-opened <strong>call for positions or presentations</strong> for a joint <strong><a href="https://w3.org/2020/maps/">W3C – OGC online workshop on standardizing maps for the Web</a></strong> , to be held during the weeks of Sept 21st through October 2nd 2020.</p>
<p>In light of current circumstances, we’ve redesigned the structure of the workshop to optimize for remote, global participation. Instead of a few days of tightly scheduled sessions, we are planning to distribute the video-conference presentations over two weeks, in late September 2020, with written discussion to continue through October, so that everyone has a chance to catch up &amp; comment on the discussion topics.</p>
<p>The <strong>goal of the workshop series is to start a conversation between web map creators, geospatial experts, and web standards editors and web browser developers</strong> , about how standardization can improve web mapping, for creators and for end users.</p>
<p>While the range of topics that can be addressed by participants is very broad, we are requesting presentations that specifically relate their content to <strong>the central topic of Web map standardization</strong> , such as accessibility, internationalization, discovery, privacy, security, extensibility etc.</p>
<p>We also want to continue with the original plan to have “hack” sessions, where community members can welcome new contributors to their open-source projects. The full details are still being worked out, and feedback or suggestions are welcome.</p>
<p>The <strong>deadline for proposals is June 30th</strong> , so that we have plenty of time to arrange a full agenda before September. It would also be helpful, if you are interested, if you could fill in the <strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/1/maps2020/">registration form</a></strong> sooner rather than later, so that we know who is interested, and what you’re interested in.</p>
<p>Please, share the news about the workshop within your organizations and communities, and with anyone else you think would be interested in improving maps on the web.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact me directly, or to email the <strong><a href="mailto:public-maps-workshop-pc@w3.org?subject=W3C%20-%20OGC%20Joint%20Online%20Workshop%20on%20Web%20Maps%20-%20September%2021st%20-%20October%202nd%202020">program committee</a></strong> with any questions you may have.</p>
