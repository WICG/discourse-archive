<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I run a small software shop that wants to make progressive web applications our primary distribution model. However, there are a few absolutely important things holding us back. Many of the things we want to do aren’t possible without a few capabilities that currently don’t exist.</p>
<p>As such, I decided to throw together a list of proposals that I think could open the door to many new apps to be written and delivered as PWAs.</p>
<p>This list is sorted into a few categories: device access, network access, OS integration, and process management.</p>
<p>I’ve selected each proposal based on the major improvements they’d make to either business logic capabilities and/or user experience improvement. Each proposal may also have a few notes. They are not sorted in any particular order.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in.</p>
<h2>Device Access</h2>
<h4><a class="inline-onebox" href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/writable-file-api/1433">Writable file API</a></h4>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: This API would allow web applications to request permanent access to a file and/or directory on the device’s disk. It can be scoped by file type.</p>
<p><strong>Why this was chosen</strong>: Currently, web applications lack a good way to access the basic capabilities of continued access to files and folders on disk. This hampers applications such as music managers, photo galleries, and IDEs.</p>
<h4><a class="inline-onebox" href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/human-interface-device-hid-api/3070">Human Interface Device (HID) API</a></h4>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: This API would allow web applications to request access to certain HIDs.</p>
<p><strong>Why this was chosen</strong>: Currently, you cannot interface with a non-standard HID from a web application. This causes us to need a native application to interface with these devices, where it sometimes may not make sense.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This one may make less and less sense as time goes on with the introduction of other APIs such as WebBluetooth.</p>
<h2>Network Access</h2>
<h4><a class="inline-onebox" href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/webtransport-proposal/3508">WebTransport Proposal</a></h4>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: It’s a UDP-like protocol and API accessible by web applications.</p>
<p><strong>Why this was chosen</strong>: Web applications currently lack extremely high speed and low-reliability communications. This can cause setbacks for high-fidelity video streaming, game state updates, and other use cases.</p>
<h4><a class="inline-onebox" href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-full-network-access-in-progressive-web-apps/3602">[Proposal] Full Network Access in Progressive Web Apps</a></h4>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: These APIs would allow an installed PWA to sidestep content security policy and/or cross-origin resource security, send and receive arbitrary bytes to and from arbitrary servers, and access details such as the public and private IP addresses of the device.</p>
<p><strong>Why this was chosen</strong>: Web applications, especially client-only ones, lack a good way to communicate with third-party servers to retrieve assets without extra infrastructure. This would allow said applications to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: I authored this one, and it’s <em>incredibly</em> sensitive to security concerns. This is an extremely powerful capability that can cause a lot of damage if abused.</p>
<h2>OS Integration</h2>
<h4><a class="inline-onebox" href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-contact-picker-api/3507">[Proposal] Contact Picker API</a></h4>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: This API would allow web applications to open a native contact picker and select one or more contacts from the native contact book.</p>
<p><strong>Why this was chosen</strong>: Web applications currently lack a good way to retrieve contact information, which could be useful to, for example, share a contact, quickly send information to a person, bootstrap an in-app contacts list, learn an address, and more.</p>
<h4><a class="inline-onebox" href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-lifecycle-for-the-web-for-system-initiated-resource-re-allocation/2319">[Proposal] Lifecycle for the Web - for system initiated resource re-allocation</a></h4>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: This API would allow web applications to retrieve and handle lifecycle events dispatched by the operating system.</p>
<p><strong>Why this was chosen</strong>: Web applications, currently, can use a ton of resources in the background when another program is being used or the system is in a battery saver state. This would allow web applications to be actively respond and prepare for operating system level lifecycle events, creating a better user experience.</p>
<h2>Process Management</h2>
<h4><a class="inline-onebox" href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/main-thread-scheduling/3418">Main Thread Scheduling</a></h4>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: This set of APIs would allow web applications to schedule the event loop, in order to prioritize certain events.</p>
<p><strong>Why this was chosen</strong>: Web applications can sometimes feel unresponsive. This would allow particularly intensive web apps to schedule what’s being executed to prioritize, say, updating the UI or doing certain work first.</p>
<h4><a class="inline-onebox" href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/a-way-to-the-use-dom-in-a-web-worker/2483">A way to the use DOM in a Web Worker</a></h4>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: This API would allow web workers to access the DOM, allowing a UI multi-threading of sorts on the web.</p>
<p><strong>Why this was chosen</strong>: This would allow web applications to have multiple threads updating the DOM at the same time. This is a huge deal for concurrent computation and responsiveness. For example, a video editing application could have the main thread handling user input, a few workers processing the video and updating the display, and another worker handling audio.</p>
<h4><a class="inline-onebox" href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-exposing-input-events-to-worker-threads/3479">Proposal: Exposing input events to worker threads</a></h4>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: This API would allow Web Workers to access input events.</p>
<p><strong>Why this was chosen</strong>: This would enable superior UI responsiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This goes hand-in-hand with the previous entry.</p>

<p>That’s all for now. I will edit this post as proposals get axed, accepted, and posted to the forum.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, and please do reply if you feel the need.</p>
