<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I (along with some colleagues) have been considering how to bring annotation capabilities to mainstream browsers. Briefly, annotation allows users and authors to create resources <em>about</em> other resources - the straightforward example would be adding comments to a page (e.g. think Google Docs comments for the web). Wondering if there’s others who’d like to collaborate and help make this a reality.</p>
<p>A standard for annotations on the web already exists in the W3C; <a href="https://www.w3.org/annotation/">WebAnnotation</a> lays out a data model and protocol for annotating web content. Browser annotations should be built on this standard. That said, I think there’s some problems remaining to solve before we could bring annotations to a web browser.</p>
<p>I’ve written an <a href="https://github.com/bokand/web-annotations/blob/main/README.md" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">explainer</a> to provide a more in-depth introduction and layout of the challenges. To give a flavor of the kinds of things we’d need to solve:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are annotation sources linked? Existing annotation tools are special-purpose and come linked to their own backend. A browser shouldn’t be restricted to a single annotation source. Should users be able to plug-in annotation sources and how would that work? Could a URL include an annotation source to use for the given resource? Could we encode annotations directly into a URL?</li>
<li>Author controls - existing annotation tools are installed intentionally by users and are a negligible proportion of web traffic. If all/most web traffic becomes annotation enabled - authors would likely demand controls. Perhaps some form of opt-out or default visibility, styling and presentation control, etc.</li>
<li>Hosts of annotations will need the ability to moderate their content. What kind of controls and feedback should browser UI provide? (e.g. “flag comment”? up/down vote?)</li>
<li>Security and privacy challenges to be worked out</li>
<li>How to handle identity and attribution</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re still quite early into this so there’s nothing’s fully baked yet but I wanted to invite anyone interested to join the effort and provide feedback. To get the discussion rolling, I have put together a proposal for a first step in this direction in <a href="https://github.com/bokand/web-annotations/blob/main/URL-based-annotation.md" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">URL based annotation</a> which would allow specifying an annotation source or annotation in the URL using the fragment directive syntax, e.g.:</p>
<p><code>https://example.org#:~:note(href=https://notes.org/mynotes)</code></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><code>https://example.org#:~:note(content={&lt;&lt;Serialized JSON-LD here&gt;&gt;})</code></p>
<p>Would anyone want to move this into a WICG repo and incubate from there?</p>
