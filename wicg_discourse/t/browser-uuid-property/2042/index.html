<p>searching in github code for having a browser id (a kind of finger) i find many javascript plugin making strange algorithm sincerelly useless for having a id granting to be unique.
Consiering in cordova there is device.uuid and browser is more and more similar to a mobile device , could be usefull to have a id</p>

<p>cookies can be override for session or removed. local storage or indexed db could be better but user can remove data so you lose the identity. Instead is you assign a unique id when the browser is installed conecting to browser server id provider (firefox/chrome/… id provider) you are sure id is unique and you can trace correcly or add logic based on this new information. In this way a server can auto detect a lot of features … and has correct behaviour…</p>

<p>sorry but if i m telling to identify the browser instance … and add custom behaviour also for anonimous surfing … cookies and other caches can be removed by user. they can be used for identifcation for definition.
in my house the logic is very simple.
cache can be removed =&gt; data is lost =&gt; identity is lost =&gt; so it is proved it is useless for identification.</p>

<p>Yeah, I still don’t see why anonymous accounts are not an option. I’ll back out of this until someone else has a chance to see this thread. Just to reiterate though, removing cookies is the fault of the user, and their experience would be reduced as a result of doing so. I see no reason why that isn’t acceptable.</p>

<p>You can build things to reject users changing data on the client-side. So the session is stored server-side and the cookie just holds an identifier to that session.</p>
<p>Anything can be removed at any point not only by the user but by the browser or their OS cleaning space. This is a known thing about web dev that developers need to take into account when engineering their applications.</p>
<p>Without a clear use-case where this provides benefit over existing setups nothing is likely to be worked on. Currently, tangible use-case has been provided that isn’t already doable with the abundance of existing technologies available for session/state management.</p>

<p>1 ) why server wont handle user error.
2) user could be obliged to clear cache because for example the browser uses too much space. It dont means he want remove his configuration.<br/>
3) because is a way not praticable in the programming world because there are many server or ufficial package overrideing cookies for internal logic for temporay logic. cookie is used for temporay logic not for persistent , resilient and constant logic.
why network , and device has mac/serial id ? they could use a cookie removable? it is not the same? it is the same question.Absurd</p>

</aside>
<p>In the case of users with an account, you tie their settings to their account so when they log in again their settings are used. For anonymous users… Well, they’re anonymous for a reason. If they clear their cache (or their browser/OS <em>has</em> to) their config is gone, but they have their disk space. That’s the tradeoff.</p>

<p>Cookies are only editable by the domain. No external system should be overwriting your origin’s cookies. This is a part of the “Same Origin Policy” that browsers adhere to. If you include a package on your origin that is writing on top of your cookies, then you need to handle that conflict as the developer. It’s pretty easy, just rename the cookie name you use.</p>

</aside>
<p>Because, what you’re asking for seems to be for browser to generate a unique identifier to a user at install-time that persists for that entire install. Which, opens an extreme privacy issue since there then would be a direct identifier to a given user that currently doesn’t exist. There are side effects to be thought about where such an identifier has the ability to be extremely mis-used. They outweigh any developer benefit from having one.</p>

<li>if i have a logic saved in a server related to the browser instance. If a user remove it. You create a inconsistent state. Why handle it is stupid way when is possible to solve it in better way?</li>
<li>you answer is meanless. you suppose to use a session and a account. Why do to introduce a new condition in the question for solving it? the problems are solved not changing the condition of the question else the problem is changed.
this logically is absurd. If for the business logic ii can t register the user? if the surfing is anonimous? you answer is logically inconstent.</li>
<li>yes but it is editable and removable by user.
4)there is no privacy problem else also mac or serial device id gives privacy problem.When you reinstall a browser id changed but it logically consistent. you reinstalled all and id identifies the browser not the user.</li>

<p>Having read both comments, you need to consider what he has said. You completely disregard many of the points he makes, which is simply rude. You are bringing up the point of a user removing the data, yet Garbee already clearly stated why this is unavoidable.

<p>And that is simply not true. Cookies, local storage, and anonymous accounts all solve the problem at hand, and you have not shown how they don’t. <strong>Any</strong> data can be removed. There is no way around it, you have to plan for that. A unique ID for the browser can be erased just as readily as a browser cookie.</p>
