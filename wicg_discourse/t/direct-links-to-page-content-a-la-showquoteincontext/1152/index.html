<p>The ShowQuoteInContext Safari extension implements a nifty extension to standard HTML links: the ability to create citation links that jump directly to quoted content and highlights it.</p>
<p>Instead of taking the user to the top of a book-length web page and leaving them to maybe search out the content you cited, a ShowQuote link takes them directly to the quoted text. This adds a LOT of useful functionality, similar to citations in books and magazines with page numbers that take you directly to the relevant <em>part</em> of the source material.</p>
<p>Currently linking to specific content in a web page requires an anchor to link to. ShowQuote links don’t require anchors, so you can link to any text you want to.</p>
<p>The programmer who developed the plugin, Jean Tantra, also points out that ShowQuote links are useful for machine learning, as they give programs an easy way to show you <em>where</em> they learned something.</p>
<p>ShowQuote links work on most web pages (not redirects or iframes). Browsers not running the plugin ignore the special sauce and treat ShowQuote links like any other link.</p>
<p>I would love to see ShowQuote links included in the new HTML standard. Which would be easy to do since the work is basically done.</p>

<p>This is a frequent request, and I think it’s being considered along other <a href="http://www.w3.org/2008/WebVideo/Fragments/">Media Fragment URLs</a>, if not by that group exactly.</p>
<p>Some commonly proposed features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Link to an element using a CSS selector — <code>#css(article &gt; p:nth-of-type(9))</code>
</li>
<li>Link to an element using XPath — <code>#//*[@id="mw-content-text"]/p[6]</code>
</li>
<li>Link to literal text, as used by ShowQuoteInContext — <code>##Now is the winter of our discontent,</code>
</li>
<li>Link spatially, like SVG’s <code>viewBox()</code> fragments — <code>#viewBox(0,0,100,200)</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think what stops the W3C from proposing these is how fragile such fragments tend to be, and then they try making some web-wide archiving date &amp; time URL notation first, and then, well, they’re still working on it.</p>
<p>That said, sometimes you just want to paste your friend a link, and it doesn’t matter if it doesn’t work perfectly in a month or so.</p>
