<p>I know the answer is likely to be no; however I feel I would not be doing my job if I did not raise this here. Back in November I wrote an article on following redirects in AJAX requests: <a href="http://jotter.jonathankingston.co.uk/blog/2013/11/08/give-the-world-back-followredirects-xmlhttprequest/" rel="nofollow noopener">Give the World Back FollowRedirects XMLHttpRequest</a></p>
<p>My proposal is to add back in the optional flag into XMLHttpRequest which would let the developer opt out of following redirects; perhaps allowing them to get an optional follow callback/promise.</p>
<p>The other option would be allowing the developer to see the call stack of URL’s that had been called.</p>
<p>The merits from a front end perspective is clarity on what the server is doing; which at the moment is only is available when using CORS requests.</p>
<p>Either way, I am quite happy to hear your feedback on reimplementing this into the specification.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@josh</span> that is good to see things have evolved a little since when I wrote the article; That certainly solves one of the use cases of being able to see where the server has finally sent the client to. Which for example in a URL based single page application could indicate to the client which controller to render perhaps or some form of behaviour based upon the URL.</p>
<p>I think however it still leaves a few issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clients can’t see the full set of URL’s used in the request</li>
<li>Clients are not in control if they choose to allow the redirect
<ul>
<li>Think in a banking application perhaps where they might explicitly want to prevent any behaviour that was not expected; you know where paranoia is rife.</li>
<li>Besides HTTPS, to my knowledge there is no protection against a man in the middle redirect to a an external server (mostly though a defence in depth approach):</li>
<li>Client requests <a href="http://mysite.org" rel="nofollow noopener">mysite.org</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://mysite.org" rel="nofollow noopener">mysite.org</a> 302: <a href="http://hacker.org" rel="nofollow noopener">hacker.org</a> (to my knowledge if they serve Access-Control-Allow-Origin; they can then serve your application harmful content)</li>

<p>You can enforce that with CSP connect-src whitelisting. The new CSP 1.1 goes further to block redirects unless you opt in <code>"unsafe-redirect"</code>.</p>

<p>I doubt the redirect control would be added to XHR at this point.</p>
<p>But good news! <span class="mention">@annevk</span> working out some awesome new APIs for the fetch spec. Maybe the full request/response change could be exposed somehow. I don’t know. I remember there was some tricky CORS permission stuff it’d have to be careful about.</p>

<p>From a XHR feature set perspective the following two statements are a little contradictory as <code>responseURL</code> appears to only have been in the specification since February. I know that there appears to be issues with the redirection however from an API perspective adding new features that are optionally off should never be an issue.</p>

<p>However with that being said; I wasn’t quite aware of the far reaching goals of fetch however I guess the following covers it:</p>

<p><span class="mention">@annevk</span> perhaps you would be able to clear up some of the CORS issues; I did quite a bit of digging before writing the above article back in November however its not always clear the motives and issues causes whilst trying to implement features into the spec - hence this discourse I guess.</p>
<p>Some of my reasons for wanting full granularity of the request redirection and also control are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Headers are currently not visible for redirected requests</li>
<li>Visibility of the redirected hops through for debug and also security reasons</li>
<li>Josh has outlined CSP for a security perspective to prevent internal redirecting however for a per request granularity prevention this would need to be done at code time (Lets say for example an external agency owned a certain directory, subdomain or script on the same server)</li>
<li>A way in which the browser can verify the server behaved exactly as expected.</li>
<li>As mentioned for single applications; it is useful to behave in the same way for different content type responses from the server HTML/XML/JSON in the same manner; from a client perspective having a full trace of where they have landed is key to displaying the correct template (Assuming a design pattern where front and back end match in URL’s and behaviour).</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you both for your time.</p>

<p><a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#atomic-http-redirect-handling">http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#atomic-http-redirect-handling</a> is why there is no such feature. I could see us providing a feature which returns a network error if there’s a redirect and the response otherwise, perhaps, but even that seems somewhat dangerous.</p>

<p>Brilliant; that makes sense and I like the explicit call outs in the specification.</p>
<p>The <code>responseURL</code> combined with the CSP certainly covers most of the use cases that I realistically needed from a client side perspective. It certainly appears that it should be possible to allow developers to basically return a null error handler or similar for a redirect - as you mention passing the response through is potentially dangerous… Essentially the followRedirects support back; is this likely something that might be added to the Fetch API?</p>

<p>You mean the ability to get a network error returned if you stumbled upon a redirect rather than having the redirect followed? I think we might be able to add that at some point. I recommend filing a bug so we can keep track of the request. Probably better to wait a bit for now and have service workers et al get in browsers first.</p>
