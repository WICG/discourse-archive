<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>I would like to ask whoever runs the forum to make my account public and anonymous. Contributes with some ideas about technical specifications of html, css, js. I ask that my account be public and anonymous, considering that I no longer want to be part of this group as I don’t have time to help.</p>
<p>I am doing this, as I said at the beginning, due to lack of time and ideas. For example, I had a lot of ideas and suggestions. And thinking about it, I wonder if I was collaborating or not in some way. As I reflect on this, I don’t think I can help. In this sense, I would like to keep my name anonymous for privacy reasons, but leave the posts publicly in case anyone wants to read or criticize.</p>
<p>I ask anyone who can help me to make my account public and anonymous. So, this is something I would like. I make this request for privacy reasons as well as a personal request. And because, it contributes in some way.</p>
<p>Also, there may be users like me who would like to make the account public and anonymous. Maybe for similar reasons or not.</p>
<p>I believe that this post is important to clarify whether it is possible to make this request possible or not.</p>

<p>Is this not already possible? All messages left on the forum are already public by default. And wouldn’t creating an account with a throwaway username make one anonymous and personally unidentifiable?</p>
