<p>According to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/use-cases-for-multiple-pseudo-elements/" rel="nofollow noopener">Chris Coyier over on CSS-Tricks</a> (back in 2012) this used to be an existing spec. Apparently Alan Stearns took over the spec, but there doesn’t seem to be anything in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/#generated-content">latest spec for generated content</a>.</p>
<p>I’m confident this has been discussed at length <em>somewhere</em> and my Google skills just aren’t up to the task of finding it.  Since I’m not sure where that is and I don’t see an existing topic on this specific issue, hopefully it’s fine to ask it here.</p>
<p>The aforementioned CSS Tricks article does a pretty good job of showing the benefits. I think we can all agree that eliminating superfluous elements is a good thing.</p>
<p>Does this spec still exist? Are they still needing practical examples or are there technical challenges that need to be addressed? Do we know what’s holding this one up?</p>
<p>Any links or information would be appreciated!</p>
