<p>In level 1 and 2, physical units like <code>mm</code> and <code>in</code> were not tightly bound to <code>px</code>. UAs were expected to do their best to make stuff display at the correct size, which means they would have to know something about the screen (or printer), which might become confusing with multiple output devices. Anyhow, authors were used to assume a fixed relation between pixels and points (96:72 or 4:3), also they didn‘t understand that CSS <code>px</code> was not identical to their screens’ physical pixels. It made some sense to standardize the <code>px</code>:<code>pt</code> relationship, but the CSS WG decided to keep the <code>pt</code>:<code>in</code> ratio, too. Instead, they could have introduced a new <em>point</em> unit, e.g. <code>pp</code>. They didn’t, water, bridge, yada-yada, and now there is a fixed 3.78 px/mm ratio in level 3 (actually 96 px/in).</p>
<p>Today, CSS and its units are not only used to design websites, but also (mobile) app GUIs. On a touchscreen, the physical size of interactive widgets matters, because they are finger targets and (adult) human finger pads or tips are always in the same size spectrum, about 20±5 millimeters. Design guidelines use recommend <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/finger-friendly-design-ideal-mobile-touchscreen-target-sizes/" rel="nofollow noopener">different minimum sizes</a>, also using different conversion factors.</p>
<p>I therefore see an important use case for actual physical units in CSS. It would confuse everybody and their dog if a future level of <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values" rel="nofollow noopener">CSS Values and Units</a> added “real” versions of <code>mm</code>, <code>cm</code> etc. with different (non-SI) abbreviations. A toggle like <code>box-sizing</code> is also inelegant. So I guess a new unit tailored to the actual problem to solve would be the best solution.</p>
<p>I’d like to see <strong><code>tip</code></strong> introduced, where <code>1tip</code> equals, say, 20 millimeters (<em>not</em> <code>20mm</code>). If it should be determined more exactly, I’d say make it the 4th quintile width of the dominant index finger, i.e. 80% of adults have smaller fingers. The height is smaller for finger tips, but about the same for finger pads; the thumb width is larger.</p>
<p>PS: It seems there had already been another <a href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/one-inch-is-not-an-inch/1228/11?u=crissov">proposal like this</a> using <code>touch</code> as the moniker.</p>
<p>PPS: As it turns out, it was <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Feb/1042.html">my 2012 self who proposed <code>tip</code></a>. I totally forgot about that. I’m also not sure I was the first or last to do so on www-style, since I haven’t found the alleged <code>touch</code> proposal yet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I had proposed <code>tip</code> and other <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/837" rel="nofollow noopener">anthropometric length and time units</a> for inclusion into CSS Values and Units level 4 to the Working Group, but they were shot down in mid-January 2017 for a lack of “concrete, reasonably common, and relatable use cases”. Sadly I cannot say that decision was entirely unfounded. (Nevertheless, at the time, it demotivated me enough to not provide use cases as I had promised on 2016-12-31.)</p>

    It’d be really cool if (on devices with displays that have valid EDID info) 1in would actually be one real-world inch (and the same with other physical units), but that’s <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=551607" rel="nofollow noopener">not currently the case</a> in any browser. 
Any thoughts?

<p>I don’t like the idea of human-based measurements, because those can vary from person to person. If we had physical units that had real-world lengths (f.e. inches like the linked thread), then you could easily make this mapping for your specific use case (for example, maybe you have a certain group of people with average measurements in some specific area (in some other countries the average person is notably bigger or smaller than in the USA)).</p>
