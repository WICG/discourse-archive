<p>Hi,</p>
<p>HTML is an outdated mess from the early Web. HTML does not support a Turing-complete macros language (moreover no macroses at all). We need to make a specification of a HTML-like thing with macroses and other advanced features (with a software to convert it to regular HTML). New tags should be easily addable. (No, I don’t insist browsers to support such things as Turing-complete macroses. We can convert from my XML format to another formats before browsing.)</p>

<p>Almost since childhood I had two dreams: to discover algebraic general topology and to make my own XML standard on automatic conversion between XML namespaces. This article is related to the second…</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Extensible_modular_markup" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Extensible_modular_markup</a> (the draft specification)</p>
<p>The idea is make an “extension” of XHTML that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>based on namespaces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>feature rich</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extensible by anyone (only need to know programming)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>will support macroses and be Turing-complete</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>replaces both HTML and LaTeX as legacy (LaTeX is especially bad, need to replace it with a nice and responsible markup language).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As examples, I made namespaces for Table of Contents and for syntax coloring sources.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mathematics21.org/xml-boiler-software-automatic-transformation-of-xml-namespaces/" rel="nofollow noopener">software</a> already exists. It follows <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Automatic_transformation_of_XML_namespaces" rel="nofollow noopener">Automatic transformation of XML namespaces</a> - a sophisticated, but complex to use specification. However if you want to use only basic features, no need to know that specification (we are writing anoter Extensibe Modular Markup specification and the automatic transformations is here used just to implement a software, not as a base of EMM).</p>
<p>So, this software can be used to convert Extensible Modular Markup into regular HTML. Note that search engines also need more tags, so adding new tags is useful also for search engines and other automatic agents. However, the usage is also for Web designers and document writers to add such things as above mentioned table of contents, colorized <code>pre</code> tags, etc. Possibilities for both search engines and browsers are unlimited, because new tags can be added by users.</p>
<p>As first examples, I made namespaces for Table of Contents and for syntax coloring sources.</p>
<p>This should be standardized by W3C because my software is slow and we need alternative compatible implementations, to.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://vporton.github.io/extensible-markup/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://vporton.github.io/extensible-markup/</a> - how to add it to the WICG list of projects?</p>
<p>Please participate in development of both the specs and software. We need a really good meta-language for Web development. Plain HTML is a bad choice for writing Web page, as it even does not support macroses, or for example syntax coloring.</p>

<p>It would be very helpful if you could describe some concrete use cases which can’t be done with existing web technologies, and then describe how you would solve them with your proposal.

<p>It would be very helpful if you could describe some concrete use cases
which can’t be done with existing web technologies, and then describe
how you would solve them with your proposal. Remember that HTML is not
the only part of the open web platform—many of the things you mention
can be easily done with JavaScript, or simple transformations of XML
to HTML on the server using XSLT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One example is the documentation of XML Boiler
<a href="https://mathematics21.org/xml-boiler-software-automatic-transformation-of-xml-namespaces/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://mathematics21.org/xml-boiler-software-automatic-transformation-of-xml-namespaces/</a>
itself: It contains colorized source code listings, table of contents,
things not easily doable with other technologies.</p>
<p>As more modules added, more possibilities arrive. Consider, for example,
that we could provide full support for math formulas in HTML, with
different file formats to convert to chosen automatically.</p>
<p>With XSLT you need to find suitable XSLT scripts, manually determine the
order in which they are run, etc. My software runs XSLT scripts and
other (Python, for example) scripts in the order chosen <em>automatically</em>
based on document namespaces. This adds a lot of convenience and simplicity.</p>
<p>A future version of my software should also:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>download these XSLT or other scripts from the Web automatically, based
/automatically/ on the document namespaces, which namespace elements are
inside other elements, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>check validity of the resulting document (that there are no errors).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>JavaScript is client-side, I am creating a complementing technology,
scripts on the designer’s side. Both are useful.</p>
<p>It would be error-prone to write and choose the order to run for XSLT
scripts manually. Or consider how difficult would be implement syntax
colorization (a feature of my existing software) if you need to stick to
XSLT.</p>
<p>Also my project to <em>standardize</em> XML modules for different things.
Standardized modules are a quite different thing that home-made custom
XSLT scripts.</p>
<p>In the future some of these modules are to be supported directly by
browsers and search engines, while the others to be convertible to such
portable formats automatically.</p>
<p>“describe some concrete use cases which can’t be done with existing web
technologies” - everything can be done with plain HTML or with a custom
Python program, but my project is another level of convenience, and I
suspect this level of convenience may probably result in an exponential
simplification of complex document processing in the future.</p>
<p>Yes, these things can be done with plain XSLT. But why then nobody yet
did them? Where are HTML documents with formulas, graphs, complex
responsive graphics? We need to move into the future.</p>

<p>My Extensible Modular Markup
<a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Extensible_modular_markup" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Extensible_modular_markup</a> is not
planned to be a replacement of server-side technologies such as PHP.</p>
<p>Probably it will be used mainly by client-side Web masters, book writers
(including scientists who now use LaTeX), as well as automated file
converters. It to compete more not with PHP but for example with LaTeX
and DocBook to create HTML (or other format) documents. One use example
is to write HTML files for <a href="http://github.io" rel="nofollow noopener">github.io</a> or any other software/hardware/…
documentation. Now they use LaTeX and PDF or something other not suited
for Web purposes (often non-responsive, not viewable in browsers, etc.)</p>
<p>However, it could be used server-side, too, probably by setting a
reverse proxy which would do file format conversion and remember the
results.</p>

<p>Syntax highlighting is quite common on the web, and there are widely-used JS libraries for that purpose such as <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">https://highlightjs.org/</a>. It’s possible to generate tables of contents for paged media using CSS. JavaScript can easily find nodes in a document and build a navigation structure from them.</p>

<p>When you start by saying “HTML is an outdated mess,” people are less likely to take your proposal seriously. When your concrete use cases appear to be satisfied by existing web features, people are likely to think that you’re more interested in a new architecture than actual features. Convincing people of that after the astounding success, evolution, and growth of the web is a tall order indeed.</p>
