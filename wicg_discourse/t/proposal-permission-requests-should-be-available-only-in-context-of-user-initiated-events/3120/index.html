<p>To get rid of annoying permission prompts, it would be better to ignore permission requests that are made not in context of user-initiated events.</p>
<p>Permission prompts should have the same restrictions that are being applied to popup windows.</p>

<p>I definitely agree with this. There are so many websites that start asking for permissions as soon as Iâ€™ve arrived and I havent even done anything yet! Lol I could be wrong but I see no reason to allow permission prompts without at least giving the user a reason for requesting. Having the user attempt to do some interaction before showing permission prompt seems appropriate. This is how it works on Android and iPhone native applications.</p>

<p>I think it should be part of vendor specific feature, not a spec. some people may want to stop care about permissions.
If this have to, window.confirm() also need to be have same constraint.</p>
