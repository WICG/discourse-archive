<p>At the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/maps/agenda#day-3">Maps for the Web workshop</a>, Peter Rushforth (<span class="mention">@prushforth</span>) gave an overview of the Map Markup Language, and then gave a more detailed discussion of the syntax, with some demos, in a breakout session.</p>
<p>In addition, Simon Pieters (<span class="mention">@zcorpan</span>) presented the review that he and colleagues at Bocoup did of the current specifications.</p>

<p>There was lots of discussion in the gitter chat and in the breakout about specific aspects of the proposal.</p>
<p>PS, There’s an old Discourse thread on this subject, too, if you want some far-back background: <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/map-markup-language/1267">Map Markup Language</a></p>

<p>Comments from the live chat during Peter &amp; Simon’s presentations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SebastienDurand <span class="mention">@SebastienDurand</span>:
I would say even that min and max zoom is also critical at the layer level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amelia Bellamy-Royds <span class="mention">@AmeliaBR</span>:
Are you suggesting that the layer should automatically disappear if the map zooms in/out beyond the zoom range for the layer?</p>
<p>(because yes, that’s a very good use case, and an intuitive way to describe it!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SebastienDurand <span class="mention">@SebastienDurand</span>:
yes in some case this is critical to protect the data integrity and user experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>вкαя∂εℓℓ <span class="mention">@briankardell</span>:
I guess it is possible that not all layers can even show all tiles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bryan Haberberger <span class="mention">@thehabes</span>:
A unified coordinate reference system…that is quite the battle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SebastienDurand <span class="mention">@SebastienDurand</span>:
For example legal boundaries have a precision to them and should not be seen passed a specific scale because their position on the basemap would become inaccurate</p>
</li>

<p>Iván Sánchez Ortega <span class="mention">@IvanSanchez</span>:
Re: tile zoom, See the Leaflet concep of max/minZoom vs max/minNativeZoom <a href="https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html#gridlayer-minzoom" rel="nofollow noopener">https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html#gridlayer-minzoom</a></p>
<p>One is the zoom levels that the thing is visible at, the other is the levels of the tile pyramid with available data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SebastienDurand <span class="mention">@SebastienDurand</span>:
I am aware of these capacities in leaflet. I was just stating a behavioral requirement for map on and associated data representation in HTML. I am a big fan on leaflet at this point in time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Karl Grossner <span class="mention">@kgeographer</span>:
Are layer sources limited to tiles?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>вкαя∂εℓℓ <span class="mention">@briankardell</span>:
thanks peter, nice presentation on the idea
<span class="mention">@prushforth</span> ^</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peter Rushforth <span class="mention">@prushforth</span>:
Thanks <span class="mention">@briankardell_twitter</span> you too, great talk. Gives us a dose of reality. Break it down, and build community to help</p>
<p><span class="mention">@kgeographer</span> no I will describe more in my breakout tomorrow. but no.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fred Esch <span class="mention">@fredesch</span>:
Has anyone made a MapML react component?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peter Rushforth <span class="mention">@prushforth</span>:
Yes MicroXML was what we thought was the right idea at the time, but realize that HTML parser rules. We can , and will switch asap.</p>
<p>We would like to make TCRS into the concrete proposal that CSS WG seeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peter Rushforth <span class="mention">@prushforth</span>:
<span class="mention">@fredesch</span> no I don’t know React but would like to see how that would work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doug Schepers <span class="mention">@shepazu</span>:
Zoom and pan for CSS would be great for SVG, as well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peter Rushforth <span class="mention">@prushforth</span>:
We can build a coalition of needs with the SVG community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>вкαя∂εℓℓ <span class="mention">@briankardell</span>:
so many use cases for this, in so many diverse cases - lots of common and complex solutions over and over</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fred Esch <span class="mention">@fredesch</span>:
<span class="mention">@prushforth</span> I do react components, ping me later about this,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>вкαя∂εℓℓ <span class="mention">@briankardell</span>:
<span class="mention">@zcorpan</span> nice assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bryan Haberberger <span class="mention">@thehabes</span>:
Very cool to see a live time review!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peter Rushforth <span class="mention">@prushforth</span>:
<span class="mention">@zcorpan</span> great presentation thanks for your help with this, looking forward to more work together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simon Pieters <span class="mention">@zcorpan</span>:
Thanks <span class="mention">@prushforth</span> !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>вкαя∂εℓℓ <span class="mention">@briankardell</span>:
It would be great if the people from mapping libraries were involved in those discussion about a proposal for pan/zoom and how this could reduce their complexity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the breakout, it’s probably easier to see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/maps/supporting-material-uploads/minutes/20200924-min.html">chat recap/minutes</a>.</p>
