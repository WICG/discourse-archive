Does anyone know if don has written about this early 90’s experience somewhere? I would love to read this history</p>

<p>Simon Pieters <span class="mention">@zcorpan</span>:
I’d like to know too</p>

I like Cameron Wilson’s real estate use case and multiple tabs open in browser; I can identify with this.</p>

Don’t forget about politics. In the U.S., gerrymandering maps are a great use case.
This question may be <a href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/the-difficulty-of-discovering-ogc-services/4844">for the GeoSeer people</a>. Is there a published discovery API?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fred Esch <span class="mention">@fredesch</span>:
At my work we use the Google Maps API to show everything we need (locations, directions, …) does the existence of Google Maps make it harder for open standards adoption and getting data in open standards?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bryan Haberberger <span class="mention">@thehabes</span>:
<span class="mention">@fredesch</span> having to flip flop coords from Google to get them to draw correctly in Leaflet is infuriating.</p>

<p>Simon Pieters <span class="mention">@zcorpan</span>:
Question for Don: are there special needs/requirements for maps for NASA? Like a timeline dimension or other?</p>
<p><a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/global-maps/MYDAL2_M_SKY_WV" rel="nofollow noopener">https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/global-maps/MYDAL2_M_SKY_WV</a> has a timeline scrubber, for context <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="//discourse.wicg.io/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

<span class="mention">@zcorpan</span> I believe the previous speaker was saying something about that earlier? everything has a space and time ?</p>

Question for Cameron: shouldn’t governments require private research funded with tax dollars to make their data available for public good?</p>
<p>(also note the other NRC Canada has a public/private data lake initiative where private entities voluntarily open data)</p>

In the wednesday break-out, we will be talking about GeoJSON-T (<a href="https://github.com/kgeographer/geojson-t" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/kgeographer/geojson-t</a>)</p>

<p>Joan Masó <span class="mention">@joanma747</span>:
We have to thing on how we can express a time slider in MapML. I suppose, it is part of the “controls”.But we need the time in the URL template of tiles so it need to go as an “input” describing the time dimension of the tiles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iván Sánchez Ortega <span class="mention">@IvanSanchez</span>:
<span class="mention">@joanma747</span> That’s a fourth dimension to the map (lat, lng, zoom, time), and first we should separate the data visualization from the UI (buttons, sliders)</p>
<p>Also, one individual tile can hold several time periods (in the same vein that a RGBA image holds 4 samples)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bryan Haberberger <span class="mention">@thehabes</span>:
Would the map HTML element be able to facilitate the argument of conflicting georeferences? One task I see float around is comparing georectifications of the same map, especially when differentiating systems lie underneath.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joan Masó <span class="mention">@joanma747</span>:
Related to “think about how users consume maps”. Do users have enough with orthophotos and streets? (google maps) or they require more content?. If they require more content, we should focus on provide that content</p>
<p>Open data about covid-19 made me crazy!.</p>

<li>
<p>Doug Schepers <span class="mention">@shepazu</span>:
What types of maps are not currently supported by advertising-driven map services? (i.e. beyond navigation)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joan Masó <span class="mention">@joanma747</span>:
Most info is only indirectly referenced by code and in one format of each provider</p>
</li>

<p>Fred Esch <span class="mention">@fredesch</span>:
In Florida where I live, surveys can converted to PDF and the PDF is as legal of document as a drawn survey with a raised seal. (They can use a checksum to verify the PDF).</p>

<p>Joan Masó <span class="mention">@joanma747</span>:
I end up building python to “reconfigure” it. A interoperability disaster.</p>

I disagree with the position of some of the speakers re: “a standard will make it easier to web authors”. In my experience, the typical web author copy-pastes code from stackoverflow and doesn’t care if that’s HTML or a Leaflet snippet or a piece of made-in-hell React bloat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joan Masó <span class="mention">@joanma747</span>:
<span class="mention">@ivan</span>, You have your point. The problem is when combining data together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>вкαя∂εℓℓ <span class="mention">@briankardell</span>:
…what about maps for things that aren’t… on the earth?</p>
<p>is someone like, say… nasa, interested in mapping mars or the moon or something? do these services deal with that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iván Sánchez Ortega <span class="mention">@IvanSanchez</span>:
<span class="mention">@briankardell</span> Yes. You just change the CRS (“the EPSG Code”) and things should work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>вкαя∂εℓℓ <span class="mention">@briankardell</span>:
thanks <span class="mention">@IvanSanchez</span></p>

<p>Joan Masó <span class="mention">@joanma747</span>:
For the moment, what I saw is that we use the same technologies with other CRS. But what to do if your object is not round? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101955_Bennu" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101955_Bennu</a> <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="//discourse.wicg.io/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simon Pieters <span class="mention">@zcorpan</span>:
<span class="mention">@joanma747</span> Bennu seems spherical enough that a sphere-based CRS probably works well enough. Might be harder with something like ʻOumuamua (if there were pictures of it) <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="//discourse.wicg.io/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

<p><span class="mention">@IvanSanchez</span> I think there’s a distinction to be made between “simple to copy” and “simple to build a mental model”. A higher-level abstraction would let the copy-pasters start to understand over time what they’re doing… otherwise, we build a cargo-cult priesthood</p>
