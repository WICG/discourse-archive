<p>A few months ago, I posted about the <a href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/web-share-api-for-sharing-content-to-arbitrary-destination/1561">Web Share API</a> allowing websites to share content. That API is now implemented in Chrome as a feature trial (going to stable channel in December, as <code>navigator.share</code>).</p>
<p>It was always our intention to put out another proposal for a way to have a site receive shared content (either from a web share or from native apps), and accordingly we’ve had the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/web-share-target/blob/master/docs/explainer.md" rel="nofollow noopener">Web Share Target API explainer</a> sitting around for quite some time. We’re now looking at the design and implementation of this API.</p>
<p>One suggestion we had from Shane Caraveo was to take inspiration from Mozilla’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Social_API/Share" rel="nofollow noopener">Social Share API</a>, specifically the <code>shareURL</code> template, which means we can re-use existing features of sites like Twitter and Facebook to just open a page with a URL pre-filled with the share metadata (rather than devising our own event handler scheme). This is a bit more limited than the event-based system we had in mind, but also a lot simpler, so we might look at that design first.</p>
<p>Marcos Caceres already imported our <a href="https://github.com/WICG/web-share-target" rel="nofollow noopener">repo into WICG</a> so if you have thoughts on that, please file bugs there. But I haven’t written up the new design yet.</p>
<p>Cheers

<p>The Web Share Target API has been refined over the last few years. The <a href="https://wicg.github.io/web-share-target/level-2/" rel="nofollow noopener">latest spec</a> uses a form submission metaphor, so files can be shared.</p>
