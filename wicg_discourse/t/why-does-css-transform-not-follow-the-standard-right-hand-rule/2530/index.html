<p>For example, when applying <code>transform: rotateZ(30deg)</code> the element rotates clockwise. Why was it chosen for CSS transform rotation to be clockwise rather than using a standard convention like the right hand rule?</p>
<p>In other words, why was left handedness chosen?</p>

<p>Because rotateZ() is just rotate(), and rotate() used the standard “bearing angle” (clockwise) interpretation of angles that the rest of CSS uses.  See linear-gradient(), for example.</p>
<p>I agree that it’s somewhat confusing to have the coordinate system be left-handed, but we had this argument back when I was defining gradients, and settled on bearing angles definitively, as they seem to be more intuitive for the average person (without strong knowledge of 3D transformations).</p>

<p>Interesting. Can you expand on that bit? How are the bearing angles more intuitive? I mean, what would the thought process be for a new user who hasn’t taken any math or programming before?</p>
<p>EDIT: I just asked a designer to rotate a piece of paper 10 degrees, and they went clockwise. I asked why, and they said because it’s conventional in the programs they use, and usually things go clockwise unless stated counter-clockwise. I’ll ask some more people, namely people who aren’t coders or even designers…</p>

<p>You basically got it. Most people intuitive exposure to rotation is clock faces; they consider “0deg” to be straight forward, and CW rotation to be “normal” (and thus positive). This might also be related to left-to-right languages; you might get a more diverse set of answers from people who speak an Arabic language.</p>
<p>The alternative view (polar angles) comes from people with a strong math/geometry background, which is a minority. I went that way with the gradients spec at first, but the WG ended up going for bearing angles, for the reasons stated.</p>
